## Food safety in pregnancy

<!-- image -->

When you're pregnant it's important to choose your food carefully. Find out which foods are safe to eat and which should be avoided. The chart at the end provides more detailed information on foods in each food group.

## Alcohol

It's best to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy as it can harm your baby. No amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy.

If you need help to stop drinking, talk with your doctor, midwife or obstetrician.

## Caffeine

Too much caffeine may increase the chance of miscarriage, or your baby being born with a low birth weight. You should limit caffeine to 200mg per day. That's about:

- 1 to 2 cups of espresso coffee
- 2 to 3 cups of instant coffee
- 3 to 5 cups of tea (depending on strength), hot chocolate or cola drinks.

Energy drinks like Red Bull and V contain caffeine or guarana (another source of caffeine). It's best not to have these drinks when you're pregnant.

## Mercury and fish

Most fish have essential nutrients for your baby's brain and nervous system development, like omega-3 oils and iodine.

It's recommended you have 1 to 3 serves of fish each week. Snack sized tins of tuna and salmon have less than half a serve and are safe to eat several times a week.

However, some fish have high levels of mercury, which can be harmful to your baby, such as:

- shark (flake)
- marlin
- broadbill
- swordfish
- orange roughy (also called deep sea perch)
- catfish.

Refer to the 'safe foods' chart for more detail on these fish.

Other seafood like shellfish and crustaceans (e.g. prawns, shrimps) generally have lower mercury levels and are safe unless you regularly eat large amounts of them.

## Vitamin A and liver

Liver has high levels of a form of vitamin A called retinol. This may be harmful to a developing baby. Limit liver to very small amounts, no more than 50 grams a week.

Other foods with vitamin A are safe.

Pregnancy multivitamins contain a safe form of vitamin A called beta carotene. However, regular multivitamins that are not made for pregnancy might have retinol. Check with your pharmacist if you're not sure.

## Food contamination

Some bacteria (germs) that cause food poisoning can create problems during pregnancy. You can reduce this risk by keeping things clean, handling food safely and avoiding high-risk foods.

## Listeria

Listeria bacteria can contaminate food and cause a flu-like infection. In pregnancy, this infection can be passed on to the baby and can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth. Listeria infection is uncommon but is dangerous for you and your baby. To reduce the chance of infection:

- wash your hands well and use clean utensils when preparing food
- eat freshly prepared foods when possible
- wash raw vegetables and fruit carefully
- avoid high-risk foods like:
- -refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods that may have been stored for a long time
- -pate
- -cold, cooked chicken and deli meats, such as ham or salami, unless they're reheated to a high temperature, like on a pizza
- -coleslaws, salads and fruit salads unless you're sure they're freshly prepared
- -soft cheeses, like brie, camembert, ricotta, feta and blue cheese; but soft cheeses in cooked dishes are safe
- -soft serve ice-cream and dairy products that haven't been pasteurised (a process that kills bacteria in foods)
- -uncooked or smoked seafood and pre-cooked prawns; freshly cooked seafood and canned seafood is safe.
- When cooking or reheating food, make sure it's steaming hot, as heat kills listeria.

## Salmonella

Salmonella food poisoning can give you nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. In rare cases it can cause a miscarriage. To prevent salmonella poisoning:

- don't eat raw or undercooked (runny) eggs
- avoid foods that have raw eggs in them
- avoid using eggs with cracked shells.
- avoid raw sesame seeds and their products, including tahini, halva and hummus. Sesame seeds that have been heat treated are safe to eat.

## Toxoplasmosis

Toxoplasmosis is an infection that can harm a baby's brain and eyes. It can be found in raw meat and cat faeces (poo). To reduce the chance of infection:

- cook meat thoroughly
- wash fruit and vegetables carefully
- wear rubber gloves when handling cat litter
- wash your hands well after gardening or handling pets.

## Tips for handling food safely

- Wash your hands before you prepare or eat food.
- Use separate, clean chopping boards to avoid mixing raw and cooked foods.
- Make sure cooked foods are thoroughly cooked.
- Refrigerate hot food as soon as they stop steaming; don't let them cool on the bench for too long.
- Eat food that has been taken out of the fridge as soon as possible - preferably within 2 hours and definitely within 4 hours. If food has been out of the fridge for 4 or more hours, throw it out.
- Eat leftover foods within 24 hours and reheat them until they're steaming hot.
- Keep the fridge clean and below 5 degrees.
- Cover stored foods.

- Thaw frozen food in the fridge or microwave, not at room temperature.
- Keep raw meat in the fridge below other foods to prevent meat juices dripping onto other foods.
- Keep eggs in the fridge.
- Check the 'best before' and 'use by' dates on your foods and follow storage instructions. If in doubt, throw it out.

| Cold meats, pates and pastes | Processed meats are safe if thoroughly cooked, steaming hot and eaten soon afterwards, like on a pizza. Pate, meat paste or fish pastes in cans or jars are safe at room temperature until opened. Put them in the fridge after opening.                                                                                                     | Don't eat packaged or unpackaged ready-to-eat meats, such as ham, salami, pre-prepared chicken, or chicken loaf, unless they're reheated and steaming hot. Don't assume freshly sliced deli meats are safer than pre-packaged ones. They can be contaminated by the meat slicer. Don't eat cold meats, chicken or turkey from sandwich shops and cafes. Avoid pate that needs refrigeration before opening. |                                                                                 |
