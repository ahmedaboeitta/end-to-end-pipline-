## How to cope

- n Stretch the affected muscle and then give it a good rub until the muscle begins to relax.
- n Increase circulation by exercising your legs every night just before getting into bed.
- n Flex your foot (toes turned up) when you feel a cramp coming on.
- n Elevate the foot of your bed about 20 cm.
- n Bedclothes should be loose.
- n Consult your midwife/GP about magnesium and calcium supplements.

| 9 45g 10 11 13 14 15 16 | 5cm 100g            | I am now referred to as a foetus. My head is still relatively large. My arms and legs are growing longer. My fingers and toes have nails. A scan can show whether I am a boy or a girl. My ears, nose and mouth can be seen. My eyes have formed and are covered with skin which will become eyelids. My heart is beating at 170-175 beats per minute. The placenta and all my organs are fully formed. My muscles are developing and being coordinated by my brain, so that I can stretch my arms and legs, and open and close my mouth. 20 milk teeth are already in place. My facial features are clearly defined. I am covered by fine downy hair known as lanugo. 12.5cm My hair is beginning to grow. My eyelashes can be seen, but my eyes are still closed. I start practising breathing movements. My individual fingerprints are formed. I make rapid skeletal movements and mommy can feel fluttering or movements. She makes a special note of the date she feels the first movement. I am now called a baby. |                    |

## n Second stage

This is the actual birth process and lasts for approximately an hour and a half. This is the time when the mother 'pushes'. The baby is pushed down the birth canal with every contraction. There is no longer any resistance from the cervix. This stage ends when the baby passes through your vagina.

## n Third stage

This is the time it takes for the afterbirth (placenta) to be expelled from the body and can take from five to thirty minutes. The continued contractions of the uterus aid this process. Most mothers are hardly aware of this happening, as they are so absorbed by the wonder of the new little life they brought into the world!

## n Fourth stage

The first hour after birth is crucial for bonding with your baby. After the baby has been dried, it is put skin to skin on your chest, which helps warm the baby. It also stimulates the release of more oxytocin in your body, which aids in the contraction of the uterus and stimulates milk to flow into the breasts. Try to nurse your baby as soon after birth as possible. This is a very special bonding time for parents and baby.

## progress of labour

The head should be engaged (i.e. has started entering the pelvis) at the beginning of the first stage of labour.

## caesarean section

If you are booked for a scheduled caesarean section, do not have any food for eight hours before the operation. Get to the hospital three hours before the scheduled time.

The pushing urge is activated by the pressure of the baby's head against the pelvic floor.

After the head is delivered the face will slowly turn to one side and the shoulders will line up for delivery.

On arrival at the ward, you will have to sign consent forms and then be put on a drip, before being seen by an anaesthetist.

During this procedure, you will be given either a general or epidural anaesthetic. The procedure takes about 30 minutes to perform. Your partner or a close relative is welcome to attend the birth in theatre.

## emergency caesarean sections

A caesarean section is often necessary during a normal delivery when the contractions of the uterus are not strong enough, or the baby's head does not descend into the birth canal; when the baby is too big to be delivered normally, or the baby shows signs of fatigue during labour.

## breaking the fear, tension, pain cycle

Misconceptions and fear create tension which increases the sensation of pain. You may become afraid and turn tense because you experience pain. This causes muscular tension, and contractions could become longer and more severe.

Understanding the fear, tension and pain cycle can help you cope!

## You can break this cycle by:

- Gaining knowledge of the labour process through education. Be informed about labour and what you can expect from it. This will reduce your level of fear. Discuss any fears with your doctor/midwife.

By implementing this your levels of pain could be drastically reduced.
