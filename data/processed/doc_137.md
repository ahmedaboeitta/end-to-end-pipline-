## 2-9. Director and Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange Service

Director and Chief Executive Officer, U.S. AAFES will- a. Operate, manage, and supervise the military clothing sales stores (MCSS) Program worldwide, in accordance with the terms of a memorandum of understanding between DA and AAFES, Dallas, Texas.

b. Be responsible for the control, storage, and distribution of 'issue' MCSS inventories and optional-wear military clothing items from certified manufacturers, according to DA specifications and as developed by PEO Soldier, 5901 Putnam Road, Building 328, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 -5852, in conjunction with the textile technology team at the CCDC Soldier Center, Natick, MA 01760. (Optional-wear items are those not considered 'issue' items.) Responsibility does not include war reserve stock management.

## 2-10. Soldiers

a. Soldiers purchasing uniforms, uniform items, or heraldic items from establishments other than the MCSS must ensure that the items are authorized for wear and that they conform to appropriate military specifications or are manufactured in accordance with the UQCP or the heraldic quality control system. When items appear deficient, Soldiers should submit a Standard Form (SF) 368 (Product Quality Deficiency Report) through their servicing MCSS, where forms are available. Commercially purchased items that are authorized for wear in lieu of military-issued items must conform to the basic specification of the military-issued item, unless otherwise specified in this regulation.

(1)  All Army uniforms, uniform items, and heraldic items procured by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support and sold in the MCSS are produced in accordance with appropriate military specifications and are authorized for wear. However, in those MCSS with multi-service support agreements, some items are sold that are authorized for wear by members of other Services, but not by Army personnel. Soldiers are responsible for verifying with their chain of command which items are authorized for wear by Army personnel. Uniform items with defects in workmanship or material should be returned to the MCSS for replacement or repair.

(2)  Optional uniforms and other uniform clothing items sold in the MCSS, in exchanges, or by commercial sources will contain a label, stamp, or certificate issued by the textile technology team at the CCDC Soldier Center. Components of some optional uniforms (such as men's commercial white shirts, studs, and cuff links) are not included in the UQCP.

(3)  All heraldic items purchased from an exchange, MCSS, or commercial source will contain a hallmark or label certifying that the item was produced in accordance with the appropriate military specification by a manufacturer certified by TIOH.

(4)  All individuals purchasing uniform or insignia items from commercial sources must ensure that the items conform to the requirements in paragraphs 2-10 a (1) through 2-10 a (3).

b. All enlisted personnel will-

(1)  Maintain their clothing bag items and any supplemental clothing items they are issued, as prescribed in AR 700 -84 or CTA 50 -900.

(2)  Ensure that their uniforms and insignia conform to this regulation and DA Pam 670 -1.

c. All officers will-

(1)  Procure and maintain the uniforms and accessories appropriate to their assigned duties. See DA Pam 670 -1.

(2)  Ensure that their uniforms and insignia conform to this regulation, and in DA Pam 670 -1.

d. Soldiers will comply with all standards for uniforms and grooming for the Soldier's gender. The Army recognizes a Soldier's gender by the Soldier's gender marker in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.

## Chapter 3 Appearance and Grooming Policies

## 3-1. Personal appearance policies

a. Soldiers will present a professional image at all times and will continue to set the example in military presence, both on and off duty. Pride in appearance includes Soldiers' physical fitness and adherence to acceptable weight standards in accordance with AR 600 -9.

b. A vital ingredient of the Army's strength and military effectiveness is the pride and self-discipline that American Soldiers bring to their Service through a conservative military image. It is the responsibility of commanders to ensure that military personnel under their command present a neat and soldierly appearance. Therefore, in the absence of

specific procedures or guidelines, commanders must determine a Soldier's compliance with standards in this regulation.

c. The Army uniform regulations for standards of personal appearance and grooming are as specific as is practicable in order to establish the parameters with which Soldiers must comply.

d. Soldiers may wear religious apparel, articles, or jewelry with the uniform, to include the physical fitness uniform, as authorized by paragraph 3 -15 of this regulation. Requests for other religious accommodations related to the wear and appearance of the uniform, personal appearance, and personal grooming practices must be submitted in accordance with AR 600 -20. Wear and appearance standards for Soldiers with approved religious accommodations for hijabs, beards, and turbans are provided in paragraph 3 -16.

e. Portions of this chapter are punitive. Violation of the specific prohibitions and requirements set forth in this chapter may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ.

## 3-2. Hair and fingernail standards and grooming policies

Note. This paragraph is punitive with regard to Soldiers. Violation by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ.

## a. Hair.

(1) General. The requirement for hair grooming standards is necessary to maintain uniformity within a military population. Many hairstyles are acceptable, as long as they are neat and conservative. It is the responsibility of leaders at all levels to exercise good judgment when enforcing Army policy. All Soldiers will comply with hair, fingernail, and grooming policies while in any military uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty.

(a) Leaders will judge the appropriateness of a particular hairstyle by the guidance in this chapter and by the ability to wear all types of headgear (such as beret, patrol cap, or service cap/hat) and any protective equipment (such as protective mask or combat helmet) properly. Hairstyles (including bulk and length of hair) that do not allow Soldiers to wear any headgear properly, or that interfere with the proper wear of any protective equipment, are prohibited. Headgear will fit snugly and comfortably, without bulging or distortion from the intended shape of the headgear and without excessive gaps between the headgear and the head. Hairstyles that pose a health or safety hazard are not authorized.

(b) Extreme, eccentric, or faddish haircuts or hairstyles are not authorized. If Soldiers use dyes, tints, or bleaches, they  must choose a natural hair color. Colors that detract from a professional  military  appearance are prohibited. Therefore, Soldiers must avoid using colors that result in an extreme appearance. Applied hair colors that are prohibited include, but are not limited to, purple, blue, pink, green, orange, bright (fire-engine) red, and fluorescent or neon colors. It is the responsibility of leaders to use good judgment in determining if applied colors are acceptable, based upon the overall effect on a Soldier's appearance.

(c) Soldiers who have a texture of hair that does not part naturally may cut a part into the hair or style the hair with one part. The part will be one straight line, not slanted or curved, and will fall in the area where the Soldier would normally part the hair. Soldiers will not shape or cut designs into their hair or scalp.

(2) Male haircuts. The hair on top of the head must be neatly groomed. The length and bulk of the hair may not be excessive and must present a neat and conservative appearance. The hair must present a tapered appearance. A tapered appearance is one where the outline of the Soldier's hair conforms to the shape of the head (see scalp line in fig 3 -1), curving inward to the natural termination point at the base of the neck. When the hair is combed, it will not fall over the ears or eyebrows, or touch the collar, except for the closely cut hair at the back of the neck. The blockcut fullness in the back is permitted to a moderate degree, as long as the tapered look is maintained. Males are not authorized to wear braids, cornrows, twists, dreadlocks, or locks while in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty. Haircuts with a single, untapered patch of hair on the top of the head (not consistent with natural hair loss) are considered eccentric and are not authorized. Examples include, but are not limited to, when the head is shaved around a strip of hair down the center of the head (mohawk), around a u-shaped hair area (horseshoe), or around a patch of hair on the front top of the head (tear drop). Hair that is completely shaved or trimmed closely to the scalp is authorized. (See figs 3 -1 and 3 -2.)

(a) Sideburns. Sideburns are hair grown in front of the ear and below the point where the top portion of the ear attaches to the head. Sideburns will not extend below the bottom of the opening of the ear (see line A of  fig 3 -1). Sideburns will not be styled to taper, flair, or come to a point. The length of the individual hairs of the sideburn will not exceed 1/8 inch when fully extended.

(b) Facial hair. Males will keep their face clean-shaven when in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty. Mustaches are permitted. If worn, males will keep mustaches neatly trimmed, tapered, and tidy. Mustaches will not present a chopped off or bushy appearance, and no portion of the mustache will cover the upper lip line, extend sideways beyond

a vertical line drawn upward from the corners of the mouth (see lines C and D of fig 3 -1), or extend above a parallel line at the lowest portion of the nose (see line B of fig 3 -1). Handlebar mustaches, goatees, and beards are not authorized. If appropriate medical authority allows beard growth, the maximum length authorized for medical treatment must be specific. For example, 'The length of the beard cannot exceed 1/4 inch' (see TB Med 287). Soldiers will keep the growth trimmed to the level specified by the appropriate medical authority, but are not authorized to shape the hair growth (examples include, but are not limited to, goatees, 'Fu Manchu,' or handlebar mustaches).

(c) Wigs and hairpieces. Males are prohibited from wearing wigs or hairpieces while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty, except to cover natural baldness or physical disfiguration caused by accident or medical procedure. When worn, wigs or hairpieces will conform to the standard haircut criteria, as stated within this regulation.

(3) Female haircuts and hairstyles. The illustrations provided in figure 3 -4 are intended only to clarify language regarding authorized hair lengths and bulks. The requirements for hair regulations are to maintain uniformity within a military population for female Soldiers while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty, unless otherwise specified. Female hairstyles may not be eccentric or faddish and will present a conservative, professional appearance. For the purpose of these regulations, female hairstyles are organized into three basic categories: short length, medium length, and long length hair (see fig 3 -3).

(a) Short length. Short hair is defined as hair length that extends no more than 1 inch from the scalp (excluding bangs). Hair may be no shorter than 1/4 inch from the scalp (unless due to medical condition or injury), but may be evenly tapered to the scalp within 2 inches of the hair line edges. Bangs, if worn, may not fall below the eyebrows, may not interfere with the wear of all headgear, must lie neatly against the head, and not be visible underneath the front of the headgear. The width of the bangs may extend to the hairline at the temple.

(b) Medium length. Medium hair is defined as hair length that does not extend beyond the lower edge of the collar (in all uniforms), and extends more than 1 inch from the scalp. Medium hair may fall naturally in uniform, and is not required to be secured. When worn loose, graduated hair styles are acceptable, but the length, as measured from the end of the total hair length to the base of the collar, may not exceed 1 inch difference in length, from the front to the back. Layered hairstyles are also authorized, so long as each hair's length, as measured from the scalp to the hair's end, is generally the same length giving a tapered appearance. The regulations for the wear of bangs detailed in paragraph 3-2 a (3)( a ), apply. No portion of the bulk of the hair, as measured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches.

(c) Long length. Long hair is defined as hair length that extends beyond the lower edge of the collar. Long hair will be neatly and inconspicuously fastened or pinned above the lower edge of the collar (except when worn in accordance with para 3-2 a (j)), except that bangs may be worn. The regulations for the wear of bangs detailed in paragraph 3-2 a (3)( a ) apply. No portion of the bulk of the hair, as measured from the scalp as styled, will exceed 2 inches (except a bun, which is worn on the back of the head and may extend a maximum of 3 1/2 inches from the scalp and be no wider than the width of the head).

(d) Additional hairstyle guidelines. Faddish and exaggerated styles, to include shaved portions of the scalp other than the neckline, designs cut in the hair, unsecured ponytails (except during physical training), and unbalanced or lopsided hairstyles are prohibited. Hair will be styled so as not to interfere with the proper wear of all uniform headgear. All headgear will fit snugly and comfortably around the largest part of the head without bulging or distortion from the intended shape of the headgear and without excessive gaps. When headgear is worn, hair should not protrude at distinct angles from under the edges. Hairstyles that do not allow the headgear to be worn in this manner are prohibited. Examples of hairstyles considered to be faddish or exaggerated and thus not authorized for wear while in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty include, but are not limited to hair sculpting (eccentric texture or directional flow of any hairstyle to include spiking); buns with loose hair extending at the end; hair styles with severe angles or designs; and loose unsecured hair (not to include bangs) when medium and long hair are worn up.

(e) Devices. Hair holding devices are authorized only for the purpose of securing the hair. Soldiers will not place hair holding devices in the hair for decorative purposes. All hair holding devices must be plain and of a color as close to the Soldier's hair as is possible or clear. Authorized devices include, but are not limited to, small plain scrunchies (elastic hair bands covered with material), barrettes, combs, pins, clips, rubber bands, and hair or head bands. Such devices should conform to the natural shape of the head. Devices that are conspicuous, excessive, or decorative are prohibited. Some examples of prohibited devices include, but are not limited to: large, lacy scrunchies; beads, bows, or claw or alligator clips; clips, pins, or barrettes with butterflies, flowers, sparkles, gems, or scalloped edges; and bows made from hairpieces. Foreign material (for example, beads and decorative items) will not be used in the hair. Soldiers may not wear hairnets unless they are required for health or safety reasons, or in the performance of duties (such as those in a dining facility). No other type of hair covering is authorized in lieu of the hairnet. The commander will provide the hairnet at no cost to the Soldier.

(f) Braids, cornrows, twists, and locks. Medium and long hair may be styled with braids, cornrows, twists, or locks (see glossary for definitions). Each braid, cornrow, twist, or lock will be of uniform dimension, have a diameter no

greater than a 1/2 inch, and present a neat, professional, and well-groomed appearance. Each must have the same approximate size of spacing between the braids, cornrows, twists, or locks. Each hairstyle may be worn against the scalp or loose (free-hanging). When worn loose, such hairstyles must be worn per medium hair length guidelines or secured to the head in the same manner as described for medium or long length hair styles. Ends must be secured inconspicuously. When multiple loose braids, twists, or locks are worn, they must encompass the whole head. When braids, cornrows, twists, or locks are not worn loosely and instead worn close to the scalp, they  must stop at one consistent location of the head and must follow the natural direction of the hair when worn back, which is either in general straight lines following the shape of the head or flowing with the natural direction of the hair when worn back with one primary part in the hair (see para 3-2 a (1)( c )). Hairstyles may not be styled with designs, sharply curved lines, or zigzag lines. Only one distinctive style (braided, rolled, twisted, or locked) may be worn at one time. Braids, cornrows, twists, or locks that distinctly protrude (up or out) from the head are not authorized. The bulk of the hair may not be such that it impairs the ability to wear the advanced combat helmet (ACH) or other protective equipment or impedes the ability to operate one's assigned weapon, military equipment, or machinery. A fully serviceable ACH including all of its component parts must be worn in accordance with its technical manual to ensure a proper fit for safety.

(g) Hair extensions. Hair extensions are authorized. Extensions must have the same general appearance as the individual's natural hair and otherwise conform to this regulation.

(h) Wigs. Wigs, if worn in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty, must look natural and conform to this regulation. Wigs are not authorized to cover up unauthorized hairstyles.

(i) Physical training. Long length hair, as defined in  paragraph 3-2 a (3)( c ),  may  be  worn  in  a  ponytail  during physical training. A single pony tail centered on the back of the head is authorized in physical fitness uniforms only when within the scope of physical training, except when considered a safety hazard. The pony tail is not required to be worn above the collar. When hair securing devices are worn, they will comply with the guidelines set in paragraph 3-2 a (3)( e ). Hairstyles otherwise authorized in this chapter (such as braids, twists, and locks) may also be worn in a ponytail during physical training.

(j) Physical  training  in  utility  uniforms. Pony  tails  are  authorized  using  guidelines  set  forth  in  paragraph  32 a (3)( j ), while conducting physical training in utility uniforms. However, if the helmet is worn during physical training, hair must be secured using guidelines in paragraph 3-2 a (3)( a ) through ( j ).

b. Cosmetics.

(1)  Standards regarding cosmetics are necessary to maintain uniformity and to avoid an extreme or unprofessional appearance. Males are prohibited from wearing cosmetics, except when medically prescribed. Females are authorized to wear cosmetics with all uniforms, provided they are applied modestly and conservatively, and that they complement both the Soldier's complexion and the uniform. Leaders at all levels must exercise good judgment when interpreting and enforcing this policy.

(2)  Eccentric, exaggerated, or faddish cosmetic styles and colors, to include makeup designed to cover tattoos, are inappropriate with the uniform and are prohibited. Permanent makeup, such as eyebrow or eyeliner, is authorized as long as the makeup conforms to the standards outlined above. Eyelash extensions are not authorized unless medically prescribed.

(3)  Females will not wear shades of lipstick that distinctly contrast with the natural color of their lips, that detract from the uniform, or that are faddish, eccentric, or exaggerated.

(4)  Females will comply with the cosmetics policy while in any military uniform or while in civilian clothes on duty.

c. Fingernails. All personnel will keep fingernails clean and neatly trimmed. Males will keep nails trimmed so as not to extend beyond the fingertip unless medically required and are not authorized to wear nail polish. Females will not exceed a nail length of 1/4 inch as measured from the tip of the finger. Females will trim nails shorter if the commander determines that the longer length detracts from a professional appearance, presents a safety concern, or interferes with the performance of duties. Females may only wear clear polish when in uniform or while in civilian clothes on duty. Females may wear clear acrylic nails, provided they have a natural appearance and conform to Army standards.

d. Hygiene and body grooming. Soldiers will maintain good personal hygiene and grooming on a daily basis and wear the uniform so as not to detract from their overall military appearance.

## 3-3. Tattoo, branding, and body mutilation policy

Note. This paragraph is punitive with regard to Soldiers. Violation by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ.

- a. Tattoos and brands are permanent markings that are difficult to reverse (in terms of financial cost, discomfort, and effectiveness of removal techniques). Before obtaining either a tattoo or a brand, Soldiers should consider talking to unit leaders to ensure that they understand the Army tattoo and brand policy. The words tattoo and brand are interchangeable in regards to this policy.
- b. The following types of tattoos or brands are prejudicial to good order and discipline and are, therefore, prohibited anywhere on a Soldier's body:
- (1) Extremist. Extremist tattoos or brands are those affiliated with, depicting, or symbolizing extremist philosophies, organizations, or activities. Extremist philosophies, organizations, and activities are those which advocate racial, gender, or ethnic hatred or intolerance; advocate, create, or engage in illegal discrimination based on race, color, gender, ethnicity, religion, or national origin; or advocate violence or other unlawful means of depriving individual rights under the U.S. Constitution, and Federal or State law (see AR 600 -20).
- (2) Indecent. Indecent tattoos or brands are those that  are grossly offensive to modesty, decency, propriety, or professionalism.
- (3) Sexist. Sexist tattoos or brands are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or demeans a person based on gender.

(4) Racist. Racist tattoos or brands are those that advocate a philosophy that degrades or demeans a person based on race, ethnicity, or national origin.

c. Tattoos or brands, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on the head, face (except for permanent makeup, as provided in para 3-2 b (2)), neck (anything above the t-shirt neckline to include on or inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears), below the wrist bone, and hands, except Soldiers may have one ring tattoo on each hand, below the joint of the bottom segment (portion closest to the palm) of the finger. The wrist bone is defined as the joint that bridges the hand to the forearm. Previously documented tattoos on the neck or hands, for which Soldiers have a tattoo validation memorandum, continue to be grandfathered. Accessing applicants must adhere to this same policy.

d. Soldiers and applicants, for enlistment or appointment, may not cover tattoos or brands with bandages or make up in order to comply with the tattoo policy.

e. Commanders will perform an annual check for new tattoos or brands above the neckline, wrists, and hands. If any unauthorized tattoos are found, the Soldier must be processed in accordance with paragraph 3-3 f . Tattoos on the face or head (to include on or inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears) were never authorized locations for tattoos. Soldiers with tattoos on the head or face must be processed in accordance with paragraph 3-3 f , unless the Soldier received a written waiver upon entry into the Army. Commanders will also conduct a simultaneous check for extremist, indecent, sexist, and racist tattoos. If such tattoos exist, the Soldier must be processed in accordance with paragraph 3-3 f .

f. Commanders will ensure that Soldiers understand the tattoo policy. If a Soldier has any tattoo or brand that is prohibited under paragraph 3-3 b , has any tattoo or brand that is not authorized (such as a tattoo or brand on the face or head, or a tattoo on the neck or hand that is not grandfathered), or acquires any new tattoo or brand in violation of paragraph 3-3 c , the commander will-

(1)  Counsel the Soldier in writing. The DA Form 4856 (Developmental Counseling Form) will state that the Soldier is not in compliance with AR 670 -1, paragraph 3 -3, and will explain how the tattoo or brand violates the specific prohibition in the policy (for example, the tattoo is extremist because it is a known symbol for a specific hate group; or the new tattoo is in a prohibited location).

(2)  Provide the Soldier with no less than a period of 15 calendar days to seek medical and/or legal advice, fully consider all available options, and respond to the counseling, in writing, by informing the commander that they will appeal the finding that the tattoo or brand is in violation of policy, pursue medical procedure(s) to have the tattoo or brand removed (or changed, if applicable), or not have the tattoo or brand removed (or changed, if applicable).

(a) If the Soldier elects to appeal the finding that the tattoo or brand is in violation of policy, the commander will forward the matter to the first O -6 commander in the chain of command for a final determination.

(b) If the Soldier elects to have the tattoo or brand removed, the commander will counsel the Soldier on a plan for scheduling the medical procedure(s). Soldiers will receive  a reasonable amount of time to schedule the necessary medical procedure(s) and pay for such procedure(s) (if not available at a military treatment facility). Commanders must also determine if operational requirements will delay the medical procedure(s).

(c) If the Soldier declines to have the tattoo or brand removed, the commander will counsel the Soldier in writing. The DA Form 4856 will state that the Soldier's refusal to remove extremist, indecent, sexist, or racist tattoos or brands anywhere on the body, or refusal to remove any unauthorized tattoo or brand in accordance with  paragraph 3-3 b constitutes a violation of a lawful order and will result in adverse action. The commander will then initiate administrative separation proceedings.

(d) Company-level commanders will make determinations for current Regular and Reserve Component Soldiers that tattoos or brands comply with this policy. This authority will not be delegated further. If a tattoo or brand is discovered to violate this policy, or the Soldier wishes to appeal the determination, the commander must submit the Soldier's request to the first O -6 commander in the chain of command for decision.

g. Appropriate authorities for accession determinations are listed in paragraphs 3-3 g (1) through 3-3 g (5). These determinations are related to tattoos or brands prejudicial to good order and discipline. Requesting exceptions to policy are outlined in paragraph 3-3 i .

(1)  Accessions recruiting battalion commanders (O -5 or above), or the recruiting battalion executive officer (O -4) who has been appointed as acting commander via assumption of command orders in the absence of the battalion commander, will make initial entry determinations for new accessions that tattoos or brands comply with this policy for Regular Army (RA) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Soldiers. This authority will not be delegated further.

(2)  Commanders (O -5 or above) of Soldiers applying for officer accession programs including Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), State and Federal officer candidate programs, and warrant officer candidate programs will make initial determinations for their Soldiers that their tattoos and brands comply with this policy including the provision listed in paragraph 3-3 g .

(3)  Professors of military science (O -5 or above) will make determinations for ROTC cadets, prior to contracting and prior to commissioning, that tattoos or brands comply with this policy. This authority will not be delegated further.

(4)  Superintendent, U.S. Military Academy will make initial determinations for U.S. Military Academy cadets, prior to enrollment and prior to commissioning, that tattoos or brands comply with this policy. This authority may be delegated further.

(5)  The commandants of State and Federal officer candidate programs and warrant officer candidate programs will make determinations for candidates, prior to starting the course and prior to commissioning or appointment, that tattoos or brands comply with this policy. This authority will not be delegated further.

h. Determinations for accessions are required when it is reported (either by visual sighting or annotated on the DD Form 2807 -1 (Report of Medical History)/DD Form 2808 (Report of Medical Examination)) that a tattoo may be prohibited per paragraph 3-3 b . Determinations will be fully documented, in writing, and will include a description of all existing tattoos and their location on the body. The Soldier or applicant will receive a copy of all documentation. Unless otherwise directed by the DCS, G -1, these determinations are final. If a tattoo is discovered to violate this policy after an initial determination has been documented, commanders must submit requests for an exception to policy or for discharge through the Soldier's chain of command to the ACOM, ASCC, and/or DRU for approval. Appeals to the ACOM, ASCC, and/or DRU decision will be forwarded to the DCS, G -1 for decision.

i. Exceptions to policy for accessing applicants not meeting the criteria outlined in paragraph 3-3 c must be approved by the Director of Military Personnel Management, DCS, G -1. Such exceptions must be documented and uploaded into the Soldier's Army Military Human Resource Record (AMHRR) upon accession into the Army. Any previous delegation of approval authority for exception to policy for accessing applicants is revoked. This authority will not be further delegated.

j. Soldiers are prohibited from any unauthorized form of body mutilation, which is the willful mutilation of the body or any body parts in any manner. This prohibition does not include authorized medical alterations performed at a medical treatment facility or cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery procedures the commander normally approves. Examples of unauthorized body mutilation include, but are not limited to, tongue bifurcation (splitting of the tongue), ear gauging (enlarged holes in the lobe of the ear that are greater than 1.6 mm), unnatural shaping of teeth, ear pointing (or 'elfing'), scarification (cutting to create intentional scarring), or body modifications for the purpose of suspension (hanging by body hooks). Soldiers who entered the Army with approved body mutilation before 31 March 2014 may request an exception to policy from DCS, G -1. See DA Pam 670 -1 for processing guidance.

## 3-4. Jewelry

Note. This paragraph is punitive with regard to Soldiers. Violation by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ

a. Soldiers may wear a wristwatch, a wrist religious or identification bracelet, and a total of two rings (a wedding set is considered one ring) with Army uniforms, unless prohibited by the commander for safety or health reasons. Soldiers may also wear one activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate monitor. Any jewelry or monitors Soldiers wear while in uniform or civilian clothes on duty must be conservative. Bracelets are limited to medical alert bracelets, missing in action, prisoner of war, killed in action (black or silver color only), and religious bracelets similar in size and appearance to identification bracelets. Soldiers are authorized to wear only one item on each wrist while in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty. In addition to the one item (watch or identification bracelet) authorized to be worn on each wrist, Soldiers may wear an activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate monitor. Male Soldiers may wear a conservative tie tack or tie clasp with a necktie. Female Soldiers may wear earrings as described in paragraph 3-4 d .

b. No jewelry, other than that described in paragraphs 3-4 a or 3-4 d , can appear exposed while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty. Additional guidance on religious items is described in paragraph 3 -15. Pens and/or pencils of any color may be worn exposed in the pen and pencil slots on any uniform with such slots.

c. Attaching, affixing, or displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation to, through, or under their skin, tongue, or any other body part is prohibited. This applies to all Soldiers on or off duty. The only exception is the wear of earrings consistent with paragraph 3-4 d . (The term 'skin' is not confined to external skin but includes the tongue, lips, inside the mouth, and other surfaces of the body not readily visible.)

d. Females only are authorized to wear earrings with the service, dress, mess, and evening mess uniforms.

(1)  Earrings may be screw-on, clip-on, or post-type earrings in gold, silver, white pearl, or diamond. The earrings will not exceed 6 mm or 1/4 inch in diameter, and they must be unadorned and spherical. When worn, the earrings will fit snugly against the ear. Females may wear earrings only as a matched pair, with only one earring per ear lobe.

(2)  Females are not authorized to wear earrings with any Class C uniform (combat, utility, garrison culinary, physical fitness, field, or organizational).

(3)  When in civilian clothes on duty, female Soldiers must comply with the specifications listed in paragraph 34 d (1), when wearing earrings, unless otherwise authorized by the commander. Male Soldiers may not wear earrings when in civilian clothes on duty.

(4)  When male and female Soldiers are not in uniform and off duty, earring wear is not restricted as long as the earrings do not create or support ear gauging (enlarged holes in the lobe of the ear, greater than 1.6 mm).

e. Ankle bracelets, toe rings, necklaces (other than those described in para 3 -15), faddish (trendy) devices, medallions, amulets, and personal talismans or icons are not authorized for wear while in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty.

f. The use of gold caps, platinum caps, or caps of any unnatural color or texture (permanent or removable) for purposes of dental ornamentation is prohibited. Teeth, whether natural, capped, or veneered, will not be decorated with designs, jewels, initials, or similar ornamentation. Unnatural shaping of teeth for nonmedical reasons is prohibited. Commanders may consider waivers for permanent caps that were applied prior to the effective date of this regulation. Such waivers must be approved by the first O -5 commander in the chain of command and documented in an official memorandum, which must be uploaded to the Soldier's AMHRR. A picture of the permanent caps must be appended as an enclosure to the memorandum.

## 3-5. Wear of Army uniform at national, regional, and local events

Note. This paragraph is punitive with regard to Soldiers. Violation by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ.

a. When Army participation in a public event has been approved in accordance with AR 360 -1, commanders are responsible for determining the appropriate uniform for the event. Generally, protocol standards dictate standards of dress. For instance, when an invitation calls for business attire, the appropriate Army uniform is the service or dress uniform. However, in some instances, the Class C uniform may be appropriate. Commanders should make use of their protocol or other appropriate supporting staff for a decision regarding the appropriate uniform.

b. Commanders should use their discretion and consider the following when determining the appropriate uniform for the event:

- (1)  The nature and location of the event (for example, on-post or off-post).
- (2)  Whether the event is open to the public or not.
- (3)  The solemnity of the event.
- (4)  Who is being recognized at or by the event (is the event recognizing current Soldiers or veterans).
- (5)  Who is hosting the event.
- (6)  Who is attending the event.
- (7)  Whether the media will be present.

c. When attire is listed as 'duty uniform,' the activities undertaken drive the appropriate uniform. 'Duty uniform' does not necessarily indicate Class C uniform wear. When 'duty' is listed as the uniform for an event, commanders need to exercise good judgment for participants and attendees.

d. If an event recognizes the service and sacrifice of Soldiers for named operations, then the Army combat uniform (ACU) may be appropriate. If the event recognizes the shared sacrifice of our veterans on Veteran's Day, then the service uniform is appropriate. In all cases, the Army is on display. Commanders are expected to recognize the difference and prescribe a uniform appropriate for an event.

e. When commanders are in doubt regarding the appropriate uniform, they should seek guidance from their higher headquarters and/or the appropriate public affairs or protocol office.

## 3-6. Uniform appearance and fit

a. Appearance.

(1)  All personnel will maintain a high standard of professional dress and appearance. Uniforms will fit properly; the proper fitting of uniforms is provided in DA Pam 670 -1. Personnel must keep uniforms clean, serviceable, and roll- pressed, as necessary. Soldiers must project a military image that leaves no doubt that they live by a common military standard and uphold military order and discipline.

(2)  Consider the following when wearing items on uniforms:

(a) Keys or key chains will not be attached to the uniform on the belt, belt loops, or waistband, unless they are not visible (to include making a bulky appearance under the uniform). When authorized by the commander, Soldiers may attach visible keys or key chains to the uniform when performing duties such as charge of quarters, armorer, duty officer or noncommissioned officer (NCO), or other similar duties.

(b) Soldiers may wear an electronic device on the belt, belt loops, or waistband of the uniform. Only one electronic device (for example, cell phone) may be worn. The body of the device may not exceed the size of a Governmentissued electronic device, and the device and carrying case must be black; no other colors are authorized. If security cords or chains are attached to the device, Soldiers will conceal the cord or chain from view. Other types of electronic devices are not authorized for wear on the uniform, unless medically prescribed. If the commander issues and requires the use of other electronic devices in the performance of duties, the Soldier will carry them in the hand, pocket, briefcase, purse, bag, or some other carrying container.

(c) Soldiers will not wear keys, key chains, or electronic devices on the uniform when the commander determines such wear is inappropriate (such as in formation or during parades or ceremonies).

(d) Soldiers will not walk while engaged in activities that would interfere with the hand salute and greeting of the day, or detract from a professional image. Examples include, but are not limited to, walking while eating, using electronic devices, and smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. Soldiers are not authorized to wear wireless or non-wireless devices/earpieces  while  wearing  Army  uniforms,  except  for  headphones  as  prescribed below.  Hands-free  devices while operating a personal, commercial, or military vehicle (to include a motorcycle or bicycle) are allowed if not otherwise prohibited by policy or law in accordance with AR 385 -10.

(3)  Unless the unit or senior commander otherwise prohibits, Soldiers may use headphones, including wireless or non-wireless devices and earpieces, in uniform while performing individual physical training in indoor gyms or fitness centers. Soldiers may not wear headphones while taking the Army Physical Fitness Test. Soldiers may not wear headphones beyond the permitted area in any manner, including around the neck or attached to the uniform. Headphones will be conservative and discreet. Ear pads will not exceed 1 1/2 inches in diameter at the widest point. Soldiers may wear electronic devices, such as music players or cell phones, as prescribed above; Soldiers may also wear a solid black armband to store and carry electronic devices in the gym or fitness center. Soldiers may not wear the armband beyond the permitted area.

(4)  While in uniform, personnel will not place their hands in their pockets, except momentarily to place or retrieve objects. Soldiers will keep uniforms buttoned, zipped, and snapped. They will ensure that metallic devices such as metal insignia, belt buckles, and belt tips are free of scratches and corrosion and properly polished or properly subdued, as applicable. Soldiers will ensure all medals and ribbons are clean and not frayed. Personnel will keep boots and shoes cleaned and/or shined, as appropriate. Soldiers will replace the insignia listed in AR 700 -84 when it becomes unserviceable, or no longer conforms to standards.

(5)  Lapels and sleeves of service/dress and mess coats and jackets will be roll-pressed, without creasing. Skirts will not be creased. Trousers, slacks, and the sleeves of shirts and blouses will be creased. Personnel are not authorized to sew military creases into the uniform.

(6)  Although some uniform items are made of wash-and-wear materials, or are treated with a permanent-press finish, Soldiers may need to press these items to maintain a neat, military appearance. However, before pressing or roll pressing uniform items, Soldiers should read and comply with care instruction labels attached to the items. Use of starch, sizing, and any process that involves dry-cleaning or steam pressing will adversely affect the treatments and durability of the  wash-and-wear uniforms and is not authorized. See DA Pam 670 -1 regarding specific  guidance pertaining to each uniform.

b. Fit. Instructions for fit of uniforms are contained in DA Pam 670 -1.

c. Additional policy. Soldiers who are breastfeeding/pumping are authorized to wear an optional t-shirt specifically for that purpose (see DA Pam 670 -1). Soldiers who are actively breastfeeding their child are authorized to unzip or remove the ACU coat. Soldiers who are wearing the Army service uniform (ASU), Army green service uniform (AGSU), or mess uniform, are authorized to remove the coat and unbutton the shirt as necessary to permit breastfeeding. In accordance with 41 CFR 102 -74.426, on Federal property, a Soldier is authorized to breastfeed anywhere the Soldier and child is otherwise authorized to be. Breastfeeding Soldiers are not required to use any additional items to cover themselves or their child while breastfeeding.

## 3-7. Required or prohibited wearing of the Army uniform

Note. This paragraph is punitive with regard to Soldiers. Violation by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ.

Personnel must ensure that the clothing worn is appropriate for the occasion and reflects positively on the Army. (See DoDD 4500.54E for information concerning mandatory wear of civilian clothing in foreign countries. The individual's travel orders will reflect information authorizing wear of civilian clothing.)

c. Personnel on official travel and traveling by commercial travel means may wear the service uniform, the ACU, or appropriate civilian attire, unless restricted by the commander.

d. Soldiers may wear optional uniform items as prescribed in this regulation and DA Pam 670 -1.  All  uniform combinations are authorized for year-round wear. However, Soldiers should use appropriate discretion based upon weather conditions and duties. Wearing combinations of uniform items not prescribed in this regulation, DA Pam 670 -1, or other authorization documents approved by HQDA is prohibited. Commanders will not prescribe seasonal wear dates for uniform items, but may prescribe uniform(s) based on safety reasons (for example, for extreme cold or hot weather based on temperature).

e. Wearing a combination of civilian and military clothing is prohibited, unless prescribed in this regulation or directed by the Secretary of the Army.

f. Bags, handbags, purses, and backpacks are authorized, but must adhere to the following criteria:

(1)  Hand carried bags will be conservative and professional in appearance. Bags (to include civilian gym bags, civilian backpacks, or other similar civilian bags) must be carried only in the hand if they do not meet the criteria outlined in paragraph 3-7 f (2). DA Pam 670 -1 provides additional descriptions and wear occasions for handbags.

(2)  If Soldiers choose to wear a shoulder bag while in uniform, the bag must be black or match the colors of the camouflage pattern uniform being worn, and may not have any commercial logos. The contents of the bag may not be visible; therefore, see-through plastic or mesh bags are not authorized. Soldiers may carry authorized bags by hand, on one shoulder using a shoulder strap, or over both shoulders using both shoulder straps. Soldiers may not wear a shoulder bag in such a manner that the strap is draped diagonally across the body, with the bag resting on the hip opposite the shoulder holding the strap.

(3)  Commanders may prescribe the wear of organizational issue rucksacks in garrison and field environments.

g. Soldiers may continue to wear issued uniform items changed in design or material as long as the item remains in serviceable condition, unless specifically prohibited by this regulation or DA Pam 670 -1.

h. Civilian clothing is considered appropriate attire for individuals who are participating in civilian outdoor activities, such as volksmarches, orienteering, or similar activities. Soldiers who are spectators at these activities may wear the service uniform. Soldiers who are participating in, or observing these events, are not authorized to wear utility or field uniforms. However, commanders of participating units or of those units that provide support personnel (such as medical and traffic control personnel) may prescribe appropriate uniforms, to include utility or organizational uniforms, if warranted by the occasion, weather conditions, or activity.

i. Soldiers may wear experimental uniform items while actively engaged in an experimental uniform test program approved by Headquarters, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); Headquarters, AMC; or the Army Uniform Board, HQDA. Soldiers will not wear experimental items after completion of the test, unless such wear has been approved by HQDA.

j.

k. Wearing Army uniforms is prohibited in the following situations:

(1)  In connection with the furtherance of any political or commercial interests, or when engaged in off duty civilian employment.

(2)  When participating in public speeches, interviews, picket lines, marches, rallies, or public demonstrations, except as authorized by the first O -5 in the chain of command.

(2)  Soldiers will not wear headgear indoors, unless under arms in an official capacity, or when directed by the commander, such as for indoor ceremonial activities.

(3)  Male and female Soldiers are not required to wear headgear to evening social events (after retreat) when wearing the Army service and dress uniforms or the mess and evening mess uniforms.

(4)  Soldiers will carry their headgear, when it is not worn, in their hands while wearing service, dress, mess, and evening mess uniforms. Soldiers are authorized storage of the headgear, when it is not worn, in the Class C uniform cargo pockets, if applicable. Soldiers must fold the headgear neatly so as not to present a bulky appearance. They may also elect to store it at the small of the back, with the bill tucked in the belt, provided there is no bulky appearance and the headgear remains hidden from view. Soldiers will not attach headgear to the uniform or hang it from the belt.

## 3-8. Distinctive uniforms and uniform items

Within the confines of a military base or a DoD installation, civilian clothing will be worn subject to local regulations.

b. When on duty in civilian clothes or off duty and outside of their personal dwelling, Army personnel will present a professional image that does not detract from the profession, unless specifically exempted by the commander for specific mission requirements.

c. Soldiers are associated and identified with the Army in and out of uniform, and when on or off duty. Therefore, when civilian clothing is worn, Soldiers will ensure that their dress and personal appearance are commensurate with the high standards traditionally associated with Army service. Commanders are charged with determining and publishing the local civilian clothing policy. When on a military installation, civilian headgear will be removed indoors in accordance with established norms.

d. When civilian clothing has been authorized by competent authority for wear in a duty status in lieu of a uniform, the civilian clothing will be of the same comparable degree of formality as the uniform prescribed for such duty. Standards of dress and appearance will be conservative and meet the same high standards established for personnel in uniform.

If religious items are worn on a necklace, the visible portion of the chain may be no wider than the identification tag chain.

c. Religious jewelry that is visible or apparent when in duty uniform is authorized if it meets the standards for wear of jewelry in paragraph 3 -4. Jewelry bearing religious symbols or worn for religious reasons will not be singled out; all wear and appearance standards will apply equally to religious and non-religious jewelry.

d. Religious items that do not meet the standards of AR 670 -1 may be worn by Soldiers in uniform while they are present at a worship service, rite, or other ritual distinct to a faith or denominational group. Commanders may, for operational or safety reasons, limit the wear of non-subdued items of religious apparel during services conducted in the field based on military necessity.

e. Chaplains may wear religious attire as described in this regulation, DA Pam 670 -1, CTA 50 -900, and AR 165 -1 in the performance of religious services and other official duties as required.

(5)  Religious headgear that meets these criteria is authorized irrespective of the faith group from which it originates.

(6)  Religious headgear will not be worn in place of military headgear under circumstances when the wear of military headgear is required (for example, when the Soldier is outside or required to wear headgear indoors for a special purpose).

## 3-16. Religious accommodations

Note. The following uniform and grooming standards apply only to Soldiers with a religious accommodation request approved in accordance with AR 600 -20 for one or more of the listed practices.

a. Hijab (Head Scarf).

(1)  An accommodated Soldier may wear a hijab (head scarf) made of a subdued material in a color that closely resembles the assigned uniform (generally black, brown, green, tan, or navy blue as appropriate). The material will be free of designs or markings, except that a Soldier wearing the ACU may wear a hijab in a camouflage pattern matching the uniform. When directed by a commander, the Soldier may be required to wear a hijab made of fire-resistant material.

(2)  The hijab will be worn in a neat and conservative manner that presents a professional and well-groomed appearance. The hijab must be closely fitted to the contours of the head and neck and may not cover the eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, nose, mouth, or chin.

The bulk of the Soldier's hair and hijab may not impair the ability to wear required headgear, the ACH, or other protective equipment; impede the ability to operate an assigned weapon, military equipment, or machinery; or interfere with the ability to perform the Soldier's military duties (see fig 3 -5).

## b. Beard.

(1)  Beards (which include facial and neck hair) must be maintained to a length not to exceed 2 inches when measured from the bottom of the chin. Beard hair longer than 2 inches must be rolled and/or tied to achieve the required length. Beards must be worn in a neat and conservative manner that presents a professional appearance. Soldiers may use styling products to groom or hold the beard in place, but may not use petroleum-based products if wearing a protective mask during training. The bulk of a Soldier's beard may not impair the ability to operate an assigned weapon, military equipment, or machinery.

(2)  A mustache worn with a beard may extend sideways beyond the corners of the mouth to connect with the beard, but must be trimmed or groomed to not cover the upper lip (see fig 3 -6).

matching the uniform. Soldiers assigned to units wearing the maroon, tan, or green beret may wear an appropriately colored turban or under-turban as directed by the unit commander. When directed by a commander, the Soldier may be required to wear an under-turban made of fire-resistant material.

(2)  Unless duties, position, or assignment require a Soldier to wear the ACH or other protective headgear, Soldiers granted this accommodation are not required to wear military headgear in addition to the turban or under-turban. Rank will be displayed on the turban or under-turban when worn in circumstances where military headgear is customarily worn and removed in circumstances where military headgear is not customarily worn, such as indoors or in no-hat/nosalute designated areas.

(3)  Hair worn under the turban or under-turban is not subject to AR 670 -1 standards, but may not fall over the ears or eyebrows or touch the collar while in uniform. When the Soldier is wearing an ACH or other protective headgear with the under-turban, the bulk of the hair will be repositioned or adjusted to ensure proper fit (see fig 3 -7).

d. Physical fitness. An accommodated Soldier may wear commercial leggings under the physical fitness uniform shorts.  The  leggings  must be black in a  subdued  material. The material  will be plain,  with  no logos, patterns, or obtrusive markings. An accommodated Soldier may wear the long sleeved physical fitness shirt.

These also include badges (such as medallions) issued by military (regimental) associations. The badges are worn only while the wearer is actually attending meetings or functions of such organizations, or on occasions of ceremony (as authorized by the commander). Personnel will not wear these badges to and from such meetings or events. Items must be similar to those authorized by AR 670 -1 and worn in the same manner.

e. Badges awarded by friendly foreign nations in recognition of military activities and authorized by AR 600 -8 -22. f. Tabs are authorized for wear on either a permanent or temporary basis.

(1) Permanent wear. Tabs indicating individual marksmanship or special skill are authorized for permanent wear. The tabs authorized for permanent wear are: Sapper, Ranger, Special Forces, and President's Hundred.

The following rules apply when wearing badges from other U.S. Services:

(1)  Military combat or special skill badges awarded by other U.S. Services that are similar to U.S. Army combat or special skill badges are worn on the Army uniform in the same manner as U.S. Army combat or special skill badges, only if no Army badges are authorized for wear in the same group. For example, a Soldier who had no group 3 badges (as outlined in DA Pam 670 -1) could wear aviation badges awarded by the U.S. Air Force as group 3 badges (as Army aviation and aviator badges are worn). However, if the individual was authorized to wear an Army badge in group 3, the Soldier would not be authorized to wear the group 3 badge from the U.S. Air Force.

(2)  Skill badges awarded by other U.S. Services that are not similar to Army skill badges are worn as group 4 badges.

(3)  Badges from other U.S. Services that indicate career fields are not authorized for wear (such as U.S. Air Force medical insignia or badges used to identify the duty, function, or classification of the wearer). Some examples are U.S. Air Force fire protection, air training command instructor, security police, or Naval Qualification Badges such as the Naval aviation warfare specialist.

(4)  Personnel will not wear badges awarded by other U.S. Services that, because of size or configuration, cannot be worn as group 4 badges. Subdued embroidered or metal skill badges authorized for wear by another U.S. Service, and authorized for wear on the Army uniform, may be worn on utility uniforms in the same manner as prescribed for Army badges.
