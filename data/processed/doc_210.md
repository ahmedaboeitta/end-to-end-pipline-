We diagnosed neuroinvasive tularemia in a neonate in Utah who had culture-negative pleocytosis in cerebrospinal  fluid,  rim-enhancing  lesions  on  brain  magnetic resonance imaging, and blood microbial cell-free DNA Francisella tularensis detection. Maternal history, serologic  testing,  and Francisella sp.  identified  in  the  fallopian tube by immunohistochemistry and 16S rRNA gene PCR strongly support congenital infection.

T ularemia, caused by Francisella  tularensis ,  is  a  bac -terial  illness  endemic to the Northern Hemisphere ( 1 ).  Tularemia  classically  presents  as  ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, or typhoidal disease; other manifestations have been de -scribed ( 1 -4 ). Neuroinvasive disease, although rare and difficult to diagnose, has also been reported ( 5 -7 ).

Rarely,  vertically  transmitted  tularemia  in  ani -mals with histopathological and immunohistochemi -cal (IHC) confirmation of F. tularensis in  aborted fe -tuses  ( 8 , 9 )  has  been  reported.  One  presumed  case of human congenital infection has been reported. In 1947, Lide ( 10 ) reported delivery of a stillborn infant after tularemia was diagnosed in the mother. Gramnegative bacilli were observed in placental and fetal tissues without confirmatory testing ( 10 ).

We recently diagnosed congenital, neuroinvasive tularemia in a neonate after a positive blood test for microbial  cell-free  DNA  (cfDNA)  (Karius,  https:// kariusdx.com). IHC staining and 16S rRNA gene PCR identified F. tularensis in the mother's fallopian tube.

## The Study

A 2-week-old infant was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City,  Utah,  USA,  with  lethargy,  poor  feeding, and pallor. The mother had ulcerative colitis in remis -sion  on  infliximab  therapy.  One  week  after  her  inf -liximab dose at 34 weeks' gestation, she experienced fever, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and cervical lymph -adenopathy. After 6 days, a computed tomography scan of the neck revealed cervical lymphadenitis (Fig -ure 1). An otolaryngologist evaluated and treated her with ceftriaxone and dexamethasone. She was evalu -ated  by  obstetrics  4  days  later  for  decreased  fetal movement. A biophysical profile score of 8 was reas -suring. She underwent incision and drainage of her cervical lymph node. During the procedure, purulent fluid was encountered and sent for routine and acidfast bacilli culture; no growth was noted at 4 days on routine culture or 42 days on acid-fast bacilli culture. She completed 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate.

The  infant  was  born  at  37  weeks'  gestation  by cesarean section because of gestational hypertension and  ongoing  maternal  illness.  At  delivery,  the  in -fant required 15 minutes of respiratory support but weaned to room air and was discharged home on day of life (DOL) 2. On DOL 16, he was seen in the emer -gency  department  for  lethargy  and  decreased  oral intake.  He  was  tachycardic  but  afebrile.  Complete blood  count,  complete  metabolic  panel,  C-reactive protein,  procalcitonin,  and  blood,  urine,  and  cere -bral spinal fluid (CSF) cultures were obtained; results were notable for marked peripheral leukocytosis, el -evated C-reactive protein, hepatitis, and lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis (Table 1). The infant received ampi -cillin and ceftazidime.

Increasing lethargy and new oxygen requirement prompted transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit. At arrival, he was febrile to 39.6°C. Results of blood PCR  testing  for  adenovirus,  parvovirus  B19,  and cytomegalovirus  were  negative.  A  multiplex  PCR panel (BioFire, https://www.biofiredx.com) detected

human rhinovirus/enterovirus on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Results of multiplex PCR testing of the  CSF  (BioFire  Filmarray  Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel) were negative. During hospitalization, the in -fant developed thrombocytopenia to 115 K/ µ L. Bacte -rial blood cultures remained negative, and laboratory abnormalities improved (Table 1). He was observed for 24 hours off antibiotics, then discharged home.

He  returned  to  the  emergency  department  9 days later,  DOL 30. Vital signs were unremarkable, although he appeared unwell. He was transferred to our institution for further evaluation and infectious disease consultation.

Repeat lumbar puncture showed persistent lym -phocytic  CSF  pleocytosis,  and  he  underwent  brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast. The MRI revealed 3 lesions, 2-7 mm in diameter, located in  the  left  subthalamic  nucleus,  right  thalamus,  and left parietal cortex (Figure 1). Results of PCR testing of the CSF for toxoplasmosis were negative. Because of persistent illness and previously nondiagnostic evalu -ation,  blood  cfDNA  testing  (Karius)  was  performed, and results were positive for 804 molecules of micro -bial cfDNA/ µ L of F. tularensis DNA most aligned with subspecies holartica (Table 2). Treatment with intrave -nous (IV) ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was initiated.

The family lives on a multiple-acre property sup -plied  by  well  water  with  nearby  irrigation  canals and a beaver population. Pets consisted of 1 rabbit, 2 hunting dogs, and a cat. The family had bred rabbits until ≈ 2 years before. The cat hunted mice and voles and was frequently in close physical contact with the mother. The cat had been 'vomiting up worms' and, 2 days before the infant's second hospitalization, was run over by a tractor and died.

On day 40 postpartum, the mother was seen by an infectious disease physician because of the infant's tularemia diagnosis. She had continued to experience night sweats, fatigue, and anorexia, and new, diffuse arthralgias had developed, most prominently in her hands. Throat culture results were negative, but tests for F.  tularensis IgG  and  IgM  were  positive  (Table 2). She received 14 days of ciprofloxacin and subse -quently returned to her baseline state of health.

The  county  health  department  investigated  the home.  The  well  water  had  increased  coliform  counts, but  well  water  PCR  test  results  for F.  tularensis were negative. All other family members tested negative for

F. tularensis antibodies. Their rabbit had been euthanized and was unavailable for further testing, as was the cat.

The infant received 1 week of IV gentamicin and 4 weeks of IV ciprofloxacin. Near the end of therapy, repeat microbial cfDNA testing (Karius) demonstrat -ed a marked decline in F. tularensis microbial cfDNA levels  (Table  2).  Repeat  brain  MRI  with  contrast showed near complete resolution of the previous le -sions with only 'trace residual focus of enhancement in the left subthalamic region.' He remains well, last evaluated at 15 months of age.

The  mother  underwent  elective  tubal  ligation during  her  cesarean  section. Extensive  left-sided subacute  suppurative  salpingitis  with  serositis  inci -dentally was noted. Once the diagnosis of congenital tularemia  was  suspected,  remaining  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where results of an IHC assay for F. tularensis were positive for bacterial antigens  with  coccobacilli  in  the  left  fallopian  tube, along with necroinflammatory debris (Figure 2) ( 11 ). In addition, a gram-negative bacteria 16S rRNA gene

## Conclusions

We report vertical transmission of tularemia, result -ing in congenital infection with neuroinvasive dis -ease in a neonate. The findings of CSF lymphocytic

pleocytosis, 3 discrete brain lesions, and positive blood cfDNA testing for F. tularensis on 2 separate samples, with resolution of brain lesions after therapy, support this diagnosis. The mother's illness at 34 weeks' gesta -tion was consistent with oropharyngeal tularemia and supported  by  serologic  testing  40  days  postpartum. The detection of F. tularensis and 16S rRNA gene by PCR in the fallopian tube confirm tularemia-induced salpingitis and presumed vertical transmission.

Neuroinvasive tularemia is uncommon; lympho -cytic  meningitis is the most common manifestation. Rare reports exist of discrete brain lesions ( 5 ). Various antibiotic medications have been described in treat -ment of neuroinvasive tularemia, such as streptomy -cin,  gentamicin,  doxycycline,  chloramphenicol,  and ciprofloxacin, often in combination ( 5 ).

This case of vertical transmission of F. tularensis in  humans,  supported  with  microbiological  confir -mation by histopathological and molecular methods, is  unique.  Complications of tularemia in pregnancy have been reported previously ( 10 , 12 -14 ). The source of maternal infection remains unclear. A concurrent zoonotic  outbreak  of  tularemia  among  beavers  oc -curred in neighboring counties, and the mother had multiple  other  potential  exposures.  However,  we found no clear linkage ( 15 ).

This  case  highlights  the  possibility  of  vertical transmission  of  tularemia,  as  well  as  neurologic manifestations in  neonates.  Diagnosis  can  be  chal -lenging and require assistance from state health de -partments and specialized commercial and Centers for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  national  refer -ence laboratories.
