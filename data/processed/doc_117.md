## QUESTIONNAIRE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS

Follow instructions completely or your form will be unable to be processed.  If you have any questions, contact the office that provided you the form.

All  questions  on  this  form  must  be  answered completely and truthfully in order that the Government may make the determinations described below on a complete record. Penalties for inaccurate or false statements are discussed below. If you are a current civilian employee of the federal government: failure  to  answer  any  questions  completely  and  truthfully  could  result  in  an adverse  personnel  action  against  you,  including  loss  of  employment;  with respect to Sections 23, 27, and 29, however, neither your truthful responses nor  information  derived  from  those  responses  will  be  used  as  evidence against you in a subsequent criminal proceeding.

## Purpose of this Form

This form will be used by the United States (U.S.) Government in conducting background  investigations,  reinvestigations,  and  continuous  evaluations  of persons under consideration for, or retention of, national security positions as defined  in  5  CFR  732,  and  for  individuals  requiring  eligibility  for  access  to classified  information  under  Executive Order 12968. This form may also be used by agencies in determining whether a subject performing work for, or on behalf  of,  the  Government  under  a  contract  should  be  deemed  eligible  for logical  or  physical  access  when  the  nature  of  the  work  to  be  performed  is sensitive and could bring about an adverse effect on the national security.

Providing  this  information  is  voluntary.  If  you  do  not  provide  each  item  of requested  information,  however,  we  will  not  be  able  to  complete  your investigation, which will adversely affect your eligibility for a national security position,  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information,  or  logical  or  physical access. It is imperative that the information provided be true and accurate, to the best of your knowledge. Any information that you provide is evaluated on the  basis  of  its  currency,  seriousness,  relevance  to  the  position  and  duties, and consistency with all other information about you. Withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information may affect your eligibility for access to  classified  information,  eligibility  for  a  sensitive  position,  or  your  ability  to obtain  or  retain  Federal  or  contract  employment.  In  addition,  withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information may  affect your eligibility for physical  and  logical  access  to  federally  controlled  facilities  or  information systems.  Withholding,  misrepresenting,  or  falsifying  information  may  also negatively affect your employment prospects and job status, and the potential consequences  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  removal,  debarment  from Federal  service,  loss  of  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information,  or prosecution.

This form may become a permanent document that may be used as the basis for  future  investigations,  eligibility  determinations  for  access  to  classified information,  or  to  hold  a  sensitive  position,  suitability  or  fitness  for  Federal employment,  fitness  for  contract  employment,  or  eligibility  for  physical  and logical  access  to  federally  controlled  facilities  or  information  systems.  Your responses  to  this  form  may  be  compared  with  your  responses  to  previous SF-86 questionnaires.

The investigation conducted on the basis of information provided on this form may  be  selected  for  studies  and  analyses  in  support  of  evaluating  and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the investigative and adjudicative  methodologies. All  study  results  released  to  the  general  public will  delete  personal  identifiers  such  as  name,  Social  Security  Number,  and date and place of birth.

## Authority to Request this Information

Depending upon the purpose of your investigation, the U.S. Government is authorized to ask for this information under Executive Orders 10450, 10865, 12333, and 12968; sections 3301, 3302, and 9101 of title 5, United States Code (U.S.C.); sections 2165 and 2201 of title 42, U.S.C.; chapter 23 of title 50,  U.S.C.;  and  parts  2,  5,  731,  732,  and  736  of  title  5,  Code  of  Federal Regulations (CFR).

Your Social Security Number (SSN) is needed to identify records unique to you. Although  disclosure  of  your  SSN  is  not  mandatory,  failure  to  disclose your SSN  may  prevent  or delay the processing of your  background investigation. The authority for soliciting and verifying your SSN is Executive Order 9397, as amended by EO 13478.

## The Investigative Process

Background  investigations  for  national  security  positions  are  conducted  to gather information to determine whether you are reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and loyal to the U.S. The information that you provide on this form may be confirmed during the investigation. The investigation may extend  beyond  the  time  covered  by  this  form,  when  necessary  to  resolve issues. Your current employer may be contacted as part of the investigation, although  you  may  have  previously  indicated  on  applications  or  other  forms that  you  do  not  want  your  current  employer  to  be  contacted.  If  you  have  a security  freeze  on  your  consumer  or  credit  report  file,  then  we  may  not  be able to complete your investigation, which can adversely affect your eligibility for a national security position. To avoid such delays, you should request that the consumer reporting agencies lift the freeze in these instances.

In  addition  to  the  questions  on  this  form,  inquiry  also  is  made  about  your adherence to security requirements, your honesty and integrity, vulnerability to  exploitation  or  coercion,  falsification,  misrepresentation,  and  any  other behavior, activities, or associations that tend to demonstrate a person is not reliable, trustworthy,  or  loyal.  Federal  agency  records  checks  may  be conducted on your spouse or legally recognized civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant(s), and immediate family members. After an eligibility determination  has  been  completed,  you  also  may  be  subject  to  continuous evaluation, which may include periodic reinvestigations, to determine whether retention  in  your  position  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  interests  of  national security.

The information you provide on this form may be confirmed during the investigation, and may be used for identification purposes throughout the investigation process.

## Your Personal Interview

Some investigations will include an interview with you as a routine part of the investigative process. The investigator may ask you to explain your answers to  any  question  on  this  form.  This  provides  you  the  opportunity  to  update, clarify,  and  explain  information  on  your  form  more  completely,  which  often assists in completing your investigation. It is imperative that the interview be conducted as soon as possible after you are contacted. Postponements will delay  the  processing  of  your  investigation,  and  declining  to  be  interviewed may result in your investigation being delayed or canceled.

For the interview, you will be required to provide photo identification, such as a valid state driver's license. You may be required to provide other documents to  verify  your  identity,  as  instructed  by  your  investigator.   These  documents may  include  certification  of  any  legal  name  change,  Social  Security  card, passport,  and/or  your  birth  certificate.  You  may  also  be  asked  to  provide documents regarding information that you provide on this form, or about other matters requiring specific attention. These matters include (a) alien registration  or  naturalization  documents;  (b)  delinquent  loans  or  taxes, bankruptcies, judgments, liens, or other financial obligations; (c) agreements involving  child  custody  or  support,  alimony,  or  property  settlements;  (d) arrests, convictions, probation, and/or parole; or (e) other matters described in court records.

## Instructions for Completing this Form

1. Follow  the  instructions  provided  to  you  by  the  office  that  gave  you  this form and any other clarifying instructions, provided by that office, to assist you  with  completion  of  this  form.

5. The 5-digit  postal  Zip  Codes  are  required  to  process  your  investigation more rapidly. Refer to an automated system approved by the U.S. Postal Service to assist you with Zip Codes.
6. For telephone numbers in the U.S., ensure that the area code is included.
7. All dates provided in this form must be in Month/Day/Year or Month/Year format. Use numbers (01-12) to indicate months. For example, July 29, 1968,  should  be  written  as  07/29/1968.  If  you  are  unable  to  report  an exact date, approximate or estimate the date to the best of your ability, and indicate "APPROX." or "EST" in the field.

## Final Determination on Your Eligibility

Final  determination  on  your  eligibility  for  a  national  security  position  is  the responsibility of the Federal agency that requested your investigation and the agency that conducted your investigation. You will be provided the opportunity to explain, refute, or clarify any information before a final decision is made, if an unfavorable decision is considered. The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of prohibited categories, including but not limited to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin,  disability,  or  sexual  orientation  when  granting  access  to  classified information.

## Penalties for Inaccurate or False Statements

The  U.S.  Criminal  Code  (title  18,  section  1001)  provides  that  knowingly falsifying  or  concealing  a  material  fact  is  a  felony  which  may  result  in  fines and/or  up  to five  (5) years  imprisonment.  In  addition,  Federal  agencies generally fire, do not grant a security clearance, or disqualify individuals who have materially and deliberately falsified these forms, and this remains a part of the permanent record for future placements. Your prospects of placement or  security  clearance  are  better  if  you  answer  all  questions  truthfully  and completely. You will have adequate opportunity to explain any information you provide on this form and to make your comments part of the record.

## Disclosure Information

The  information  you  provide  is  for  the  purpose  of  investigating  you  for  a national security position, and the information will be protected from unauthorized  disclosure.  The  collection,  maintenance,  and  disclosure  of background  investigative  information  are  governed  by  the  Privacy Act.  The agency that requested the investigation and the agency that conducted the investigation  have  published  notices  in  the  Federal  Register  describing  the systems of records in which your records will be maintained. The information you provide on this form, and information collected  during  an  investigation, may  be  disclosed  without  your  consent  by  an  agency  maintaining  the information in a system of records as permitted by the Privacy Act [5 U.S.C. 552a(b)], and by routine uses, a list of which are published by the agency in the  Federal  Register.  The  office  that  gave  you  this  form  will  provide  you  a copy of its routine uses.

You will not receive prior notice of such disclosures under a routine use.

In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under the Privacy Act, all or a portion of the records or information you provide on this form or during your  investigation  may  be  disclosed  outside  of  OPM  as  a  routine  use  as outlined below.

## Section 21 - Psychological and Emotional Health

- 21A Has a court or administrative agency EVER issued an order declaring you mentally incompetent?

The U.S. government recognizes the critical importance of mental health and advocates proactive management of mental health conditions to support the wellness and recovery of Federal employees and others. Every day individuals with mental health conditions carry out their duties without presenting a security risk. While most individuals with mental health conditions do not present security risks, there may be times when such a condition can affect a person's eligibility for a security clearance.

Individuals experience a range of reactions to traumatic events. For example, the death of a loved one, divorce, major injury, service in a military combat environment, sexual assault, domestic violence, or other difficult work-related, family, personal, or medical issues may lead to grief, depression, or other responses. The government recognizes that mental health counseling and treatment may provide important support for those who have experienced such events, as well as for those with other mental health conditions. Nothing in this questionnaire is intended to discourage those who might benefit from such treatment from seeking it.

Mental health treatment and counseling, in and of itself, is not a reason to revoke or deny eligibility for access to classified information or for holding a sensitive position, suitability or fitness to obtain or retain Federal or contract employment, or eligibility for physical or logical access to federally controlled facilities or information systems. Seeking or receiving mental health care for personal wellness and recovery may contribute favorably to decisions about your eligibility.

Carefully read this authorization to release information about you, then sign and date it in ink.

I Authorize any investigator, special agent, or other duly accredited representative of the authorized Federal agency conducting my background investigation, reinvestigation, or ongoing evaluation (i.e. continuous evaluation) of my eligibility for access to classified information or, when applicable, eligibility to hold a national security sensitive position to obtain any information relating to my activities from individuals, schools, residential management agents, employers, criminal justice agencies, credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, retail business establishments, or other sources of information. This information may include, but is not limited to current and historic academic, residential, achievement, performance, attendance, disciplinary, employment, criminal,  financial, and credit information, and publicly available social media information. I authorize the Federal agency conducting my investigation, reinvestigation, or ongoing evaluation (i.e. continuous evaluation) of eligibility to disclose the record of investigation or ongoing evaluation to the requesting agency for the purpose of making a determination of suitability, or initial or continued eligibility for a national security position or eligibility for access to classified information.

I Understand that, for these purposes, publicly available social media information includes any electronic social media information that has been published or broadcast for public consumption, is available on request to the public, is accessible on-line to the public, is available to the public by subscription or purchase, or is otherwise lawfully accessible to the public.

I Understand that, for financial or lending institutions, medical institutions, hospitals, health care professionals, and other sources of information, separate specific releases may be needed, and I may be contacted for such releases at a later date.

I Authorize any investigator, special agent, or other duly accredited representative of the OPM, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of State, and any other authorized Federal agency, to request criminal record information about me from criminal justice agencies for the purpose of determining my eligibility for assignment to, or retention in, a national security position, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 9101. I understand that I may request a copy of such records as may be available to me under the law.

I Authorize custodians of records and other sources of information pertaining to me to release such information upon request of the investigator, special agent, or other duly accredited representative of any Federal agency authorized above regardless of any previous agreement to the contrary.

I Understand that the information released by records custodians and sources of information is for official use by the Federal Government only for the purposes provided in this Standard Form 86, and that it may be disclosed by the Government only as authorized by law.

## AUTHORIZATION FOR RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)

If you answered "Yes" to Section 21 of the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), carefully read this authorization to release information about you, then sign and date it in ink.

This is an authorization for the investigator to ask your health practitioner(s) the questions below concerning your mental health consultations. The U.S. government recognizes the critical importance of mental health and advocates proactive management of mental health conditions to support the wellness and recovery of Federal employees and others. The government recognizes that mental health counseling and treatment may provide important support for those who have experienced traumatic events, as well as for those with other mental health conditions. While most individuals with mental health conditions do not present security risks, there may be times when such a condition can affect a person's eligibility for a security clearance. Seeking or receiving mental health care for personal wellness and recovery may contribute favorably to decisions about your eligibility. Your signature will allow the practitioner(s) to answer only those questions identified below.

## Authorization

I am seeking assignment to or retention in a national security sensitive position. As part of the investigative process, I hereby authorize the investigator, special agent, or duly accredited representative of the authorized Federal agency conducting my background investigation, reinvestigation, or ongoing evaluation (i.e., continuous evaluation) of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a national security sensitive position to request, and my health practitioner(s) to provide, the information requested below, relating to my mental health consultations.

In accordance with HIPAA, I understand that I have the right to revoke this authorization at any time by writing to my health care provider/ entity. Revocation of this authorization is not effective until received by my health care provider/entity. I understand that I may revoke this authorization, except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization. Further, I understand that this authorization is voluntary. My treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits will not be conditioned upon my authorization of this disclosure.

I understand the information disclosed pursuant to this authorization for use by the Federal Government only for purposes provided in the Standard Form 86 will no longer be covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and that the Federal Government may redisclose the information as authorized by law, subject to Privacy Act safeguards.

Photocopies of this authorization with my signature are valid. This authorization is valid for one (1) year from the date signed or upon termination of my affiliation with the Federal Government, whichever is sooner.

## FAIR CREDIT REPORTING DISCLOSURE AND AUTHORIZATION

## Disclosure

One or more reports from consumer reporting agencies may be obtained for employment purposes pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.

## Purpose

The Federal government requires information from one or more consumer reporting agencies in order to obtain information in connection with a background investigation, reinvestigation, or ongoing evaluation (i.e. continuous evaluation) of eligibility for access to classified information, or when applicable, eligibility to hold a national security sensitive position. The information obtained may be disclosed to other Federal agencies for the above purposes in fulfillment of official responsibilities to the extent that such disclosure is permitted by law. Information from the consumer report will not be used in violation of any applicable Federal or state equal employment opportunity law or regulation.

## Authorization

I hereby authorize any investigator, special agent, or other duly accredited representative of the authorized Federal agency conducting my initial background investigation, reinvestigation, or ongoing evaluation (i.e. continuous evaluation) of my eligibility for access to classified information, or when applicable, eligibility to hold a national security sensitive position to request, and any consumer reporting agency to provide, such reports for purposes described above.

Note: If you have a security freeze on your consumer or credit report file, we will not be able to access the information necessary to complete your investigation, which can adversely affect your eligibility for a national security position. To avoid such delays, you should expeditiously respond to any requests made to release the credit freeze for the purposes as described above.

Photocopies of this authorization with my signature are valid. This authorization shall remain in effect so long as I occupy a national security sensitive position or require eligibility for access to classified information.
