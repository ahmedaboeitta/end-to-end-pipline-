## Ultrasounds, Lab Tests, &amp; Screenings

Ultrasounds, lab tests, and screenings will become important companions on your path to ensuring your baby's health and well-being. These tests and screenings provide a glimpse into the miraculous journey of pregnancy, offering valuable information about your little one's development and ensuring their safe passage into the world.

Typically the first screening appointment is where your Women's Health provider will review your medical history, conduct a physical examination, and order baseline blood tests to establish your health status at the beginning of pregnancy.

## 6-10 Weeks

## EARLY ULTRASOUND

You may have an ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy and determine the gestational age. This scan can also detect the presence of a fetal heartbeat.

## 15-22 Weeks QUAD BLOOD TEST

This blood test is performed to assess the risk of neural tube defects and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and neural tube defects. The test measures the levels of four substances

- Alpha-fetoprotein
- Human chorionic gonadotropin
- Estriol
- Inhibin

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 19-20 Weeks ANATOMY ULTRASOUND

The purpose of this ultrasound is to examine the baby's spine, head, and placenta. Additionally, this ultrasound can reveal the baby's gender if you desire.

## 21-28 WEEKS GLUCOSE SCREENING

Screens for gestational diabetes by measuring blood sugar levels after consuming a glucose drink. If the GCT result is elevated, a follow-up blood glucose test may be performed to confirm gestational diabetes.

## 28-32 Weeks 3D LIVE ULTRASOUND

## This is an innovative technology

that creates a three-dimensional image of the fetus using sound waves. It provides a more detailed and realistic view of the baby's features, allowing parents to see facial features and other anatomical details with depth and clarity. This ultrasound is available to Ogden Clinic OB patients.

## 35-37 Weeks

## GROUP B STREP CULTURE

Tests for the presence of bacteria in the mother's rectum and vagina that could potentially harm the baby during delivery.

<!-- image -->

## Fetal Movement &amp; Baby Kick Counts

By keeping track of movements, you monitor your baby's health and create a bond with him/her. Babies tend to be most active in the evening, so this is the best time to monitor their flutters and kicks.

## FETAL MOVEMENT

## WHEN CAN I FEEL IT

Typically between 16-24 weeks. Baby's movements should be felt right up until they are born, even during labor.

## WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE

- Initially: subtle flutters or swishes
- Later: kicks, punches and rolls

## HOW FREQUENT IS IT

Varies from baby to baby. There is no set of normal movements. Women should be encouraged to get to know their baby's movements and what is normal for them and their baby.

## BABY KICK COUNTS

## WHEN TO START COUNTING

- After 20 weeks of pregnancy

## HOW TO START COUNTING

Choose a time when you are least distracted or when you typically feel the fetus move.

1.  Get comfortable. Lie on your side or sit with your feet propped up.
2.  Place your hands on your belly.
3.  Start a timer or watch the clock.
4.  Count each kick. Keep counting until you get to 10 kicks. Once you reach 10 kicks, jot down how many minutes it took.

<!-- image -->

If you feel less than four fetal movements in an hour, drink a glass of cold water or orange juice, wait 20 minutes, then repeat an evaluation for another hour. If decreased fetal movement persists, please call us for next steps.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that you time how long it takes you to feel 10 kicks, flutters, swishes, or rolls. Ideally, you want to feel 10 movements within one hour.

## Bleeding During Pregnancy

Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy has many causes. Some are serious and others are not. Bleeding can occur early or later in pregnancy. Bleeding in early pregnancy is common. In many cases, it does not signal a major problem. Bleeding later in pregnancy can be more serious. If you experience bleeding at any time, please contact us.

## How Common is Bleeding?

Bleeding in the first trimester happens in 15 -25% of pregnancies. Light bleeding or spotting can occur one to two weeks after fertilization. The cervix may bleed more easily during pregnancy because more blood vessels are developing in this area.

It is not uncommon to have spotting or light bleeding after sexual intercourse or after a pap smear. Problems that can cause bleeding in early pregnancy include infection, early pregnancy loss, and ectopic pregnancy.

<!-- image -->

## Early Pregnancy Loss

Loss of a pregnancy during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy is called early pregnancy loss or miscarriage. It happens in about 10 in 100 known pregnancies. Bleeding and cramping are signs of early pregnancy loss. But about half of women who have a miscarriage do not have any bleeding beforehand.

If you have had an early pregnancy loss, some of the pregnancy tissue may be left in the uterus. This tissue needs to be removed. You can allow the tissue to pass naturally, or it can be removed with medication or surgery.

## Bleeding Later in Pregnancy

Common problems that may cause light bleeding later in pregnancy include inflammation of or growths on the cervix.

<!-- image -->

Heavy bleeding is a more serious sign. Heavy bleeding may be caused by a problem with the placenta.

Any amount of bleeding also may signal preterm labor. If you have any bleeding late in pregnancy, contact your ob-gyn right away or go to the hospital.

## Normal Symptoms You May Experience

As your body changes, you'll experience many new symptoms. The symptoms below are normal, but if they are excessively painful, please bring them to our attention.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## SEX:

Permissible anytime during pregnancy as long as you do not have vaginal bleeding, ruptured membranes, or a tendency toward pre-term labor. Be aware that spotting may occur.

## TRAVEL:

In most cases, , traveling up to 36 weeks of pregnancy is generally considered safe. . Travel may not be recommended if you have pregnancy complications. If you are planning a trip, talk with your OB/GYN.

## EXERCISE

Exercise is safe for healthy women and beneficial for fetal and maternal health.

## Unsafe

## EXCESSIVE HEAT:

Do not use saunas, tanning booths, or hot tubs due to the risk of excessive heat.

## X-RAYS/IMAGING

Do not have an X-ray or imaging unless absolutely necessary while pregnant.

## CAT LITTER:

Cat litter poses a risk of toxoplasmosis, harmful toxins for a fetus. Do not change a cat litter box during pregnancy.

## Safe &amp; Unsafe During Pregnancy

## Morning Sickness

<!-- image -->

Nausea and vomiting are common, especially early in pregnancy. They can occur any time during the day, even though it's often called 'morning sickness.' Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy usually don't harm the fetus, but it can affect your life, including your ability to work or go about your normal everyday activities.

Many women find this symptom subsides after 14 weeks, but for some, it may last throughout pregnancy. There are safe treatment options that can make you feel better and keep your symptoms from getting worse.

## Try these lifestyle adjustments:

- Eat dry toast or crackers in the morning before you get out of bed to avoid moving around on an empty stomach.
- Eat five or six 'mini meals' a day to ensure that your stomach is never empty.
- Eat frequent bites of foods like nuts, fruits, or crackers.
- Try ingesting ginger, such as ginger candies, freshly grated ginger inside tea, or ginger ale.
- Try a bland diet such as BRATT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, and tea). This diet is low in fat and easy to digest.
- Stay well hydrated. You need more water during pregnancy, especially if vomiting occurs.

## Don't Do This Over-the-Counter supplements:

<!-- image -->

- Ginger tablets
- Vitamin B6
- Doxylamine: a medication found in OTC sleep aids. This can be added if vitamin B6 alone does not relieve symptoms.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

For more information about Morning Sickness, including the small risk (3%) of hyperemesis gravidarum, visit this ACOG FAQ page.

## Supporting Your Pregnant Partner

Pregnancy is exciting, but it can be equally anxiety-inducing and emotional. Be there for your partner and support her through all the ups and downs. Make her feel loved, cared for, and heard.

Listen to her when she expresses her worries or thoughts and make her feel reassured. Remind her she always has a

<!-- image -->

shoulder to cry on and never judge her for her emotions. Remind her about how much you care for her and offer support when needed.

## PHYSICAL SUPPORT

## MEDICAL SUPPORT

Carrying and growing a baby inside you for nine months is no easy task. In the first trimester, your partner may be dealing with morning sickness. In the third trimester, sleepless nights and pain become a regular occurrence. You can support her by taking on more chores and tasks around the house and finding ways to make her a little more comfortable, such as finding her a pregnancy pillow or giving her a massage.

## FAQS

Get ready for lots of doctor appointments. Whether going to her ultrasound appointments or newborn baby class, try to accompany your partner as much as possible. These appointments can be extremely stressful, especially in the beginning. If you cannot be there for some reason, make sure to video call or check in before, during, and after the appointment. Write down any information the nurses and doctors tell you and your partner.

## PREGNANCY • LABOR •  DELIVERY

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has a great guide on every question you may have about your partner's pregnancy, what to expect during labor, and what to expect after the baby arrives. We encourage you to read through these common Qs &amp; As.

## Laborist Program

## What if I go into labor at night or when my doctor isn't available?

In 2015, our staff at Ogden Clinic established the Laborist Program to meet the needs of expectant parents. This care model incorporates OB/GYN doctors and provides continuous, comprehensive care for patients delivering babies or responding to emergencies that may arise.

<!-- image -->

Ogden Clinic on-call OBs for emergencies and deliveries.

<!-- image -->

Laborists are practicing OB/GYNs who work a set schedule that offers them time to rest while offering patients the benefit of 24/7 medical coverage. It's crucial that our expectant patients have a lifeline in case of early delivery or medical emergencies. You are in excellent hands with Ogden Clinic's board-certified laborists who perform inpatient OB/GYN care, admitting patients, triage, emergency services, and deliveries including high-risk pregnancies.

No matter the time of day, expectant mothers and their families have access to pregnancy care and labor-related services. Patients have the option to be evaluated by OB/GYNs experienced in emergency care and can have immediate access to obstetric surgical care if life-saving procedures for the mother and baby are necessary.
