In recent years, the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) has increased, accounting for almost 63% ofall deaths in the country. The NCDs have outnumbered the communicable diseases, maternal and neonatal diseases in terms of mortality and morbidity. Changes in lifestyles, behavioral patterns, demographic profile, and socio-cultural environment are leading to sharp increase in the prevalence of NCDs.

Under the National Health Mission (NHM), the National Programme for the Prevention and Control of Non Communicable Diseases is implemented to cater to common NCDs, such as Cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes,cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, chronic kidney disease etc. Under Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres, the Population-Based Screening (PBS) of common NCDs and promotion of healthy lifestyle are being done.

The current operational guidelines have been drafted focusing on primary and secondary prevention, clinical support for NCDs, and programme management with an objective to integrate NCD care at various healthcare delivery levels to meet Sustainable Development Goal-3.4.

The Government of India, under the visionary leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi Ji, is committed to meet the health needs of the people of India. The programme managers at State/District NCD cells will find these guidelines useful in successfully implementing the interventions for management of NCDs in the country.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

<!-- image -->

- i. Health  systems  in  India  are  evolving  in  alignment  with  shifting  health  needs  and disease burden with expanded emphasis on Non Communicable Diseases. Realizing the role of prevention and control of NCDs in improving the overall health outcomes and  addressing  the  three  pillars  of  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  i.e., economic growth, social equity and environmental protection, it was identified as a prerequisite to accelerate sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations in 2015 recognized NCDs as a major public health challenge and included SDG target 3.4 to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one -third.
- ii. The National Health Policy (NHP), 2017 recognizes the pivotal importance of SDGs and highlighted the need to halt and reverse the growing incidence of chronic diseases including  NCDs.  The  NHP  2017  defined  this  objective  as  'Improve  health  status through  concerted  policy  action  in  all  sectors  and  expand  preventive,  promotive, curative,  palliative  and  rehabilitative  services  provided  through  the  public  health sector with focus on quality.' Addressing the growing burden of NCDs and carving the route towards progressive attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the policy outlined  indicative,  quantitative  goals  and  objectives  for  reducing  prevalence  and incidence for NCDs, aligned to achieve SDGs in keeping with the policy thrust.
- iii. The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD)  erstwhile  National  Programme  for  Prevention  and  Control  of  Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) was launched in 2010 in 100 districts across 21 states with an objective to prevent and control major NCDs. The programme was scaled up in a phased manner and now covers all the districts across the country. The focus of NPCDCS was to enable opportunistic screening for common NCDs at District Hospital and Community Health Centres level, through the setting up of NCD clinics.
- iv. In order to expand the services and bring them closer to the community, Population Based  Screening  (PBS)  for  common  NCDs  was  launched  in  year  2016.  The  PBS includes screening of individuals of 30 years and above age group for five common NCDs i.e., Hypertension, Diabetes, Cancers of the oral cavity, cervix and breast. The key components of this initiative include population enumeration, assessment of risk factors,  mobilizing  communities  for  screening  at  Sub-Centres  (SC),  Primary  Health Centres (PHC) in rural and urban areas, health promotion, initiation of treatment at a PHC, referral to higher centres for further treatment, if required. Both upward and downward referral, follow up is provided under the programme to ensure continuum of care.

- v. Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) has an important role  in  the  primary and secondary prevention of several disease conditions, including NCDs which today contribute  to  63%  of  the  mortality  in  India.  The  provision  of  primary  health  care reduces  morbidity,  disability  and  mortality  at  much  lower  costs  and  significantly reduces the need for secondary and tertiary care.
- vi. As  a  step  towards  ensuring  provision  of  promotive,  preventive,  curative,  palliative and  rehabilitative  aspects  of  Universal  Healthcare,  Government  of  India  launched its  flagship  programme  of  Ayushman  Bharat  in  2018.  Ayushman  Bharat  has  two components to ensure Universal Health Coverage (UHC) viz Ayushman Bharat - Health and  Wellness  Centre  and  Ayushman  Bharat  -  Pradhan  Mantri  Jan  Aarogya  Yojana (PM-JAY). This ensures Comprehensive Primary Health Care at the primary level and provision  of  financial  protection  for  accessing  curative  care  at  the  secondary  and tertiary levels through engagement with both public and private sector.
- vii. In order to ensure primary health care which is close to the community, health facilities in urban and rural areas are being strengthened. At the SHC-HWC level, a new cadre of Community Health Officer (CHO) has been introduced to lead the HWC team and provide expanded range of twelve services. The Medical officer of the Primary Health Centre (rural and urban) would supervise the functioning of the HWC.
- viii. Focussing on the technology and IT based solution in healthcare, Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) was launched with an aim to strengthen the accessibility and equity of health services, including continuum of care with citizen as the owner of data. The initiative provides a platform for all existing and upcoming IT applications to  function  in  an  integrated  approach,  maintaining  the  interoperability.  Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) is an unique identifier (self-declared username) that enables to share and access health records digitally. It serves as a common linkage between healthcare programmes.
- ix. Realizing  the  growing  burden  of  NCDs,  associated  morbidities  and  mortalities, Government of India has identified other priority NCD conditions beyond common NCDs and widened the ambit of the programme by including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP). Hence, the NPCDCS is now renamed as National Programme for Prevention &amp; Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD).
- x. All  the  guidelines  were  shared  with  States/UTs  for  implementation  by  programme managers and other healthcare providers to strengthen health care services for the NCDs  across  all  levels  of  care,  and  also  to  enable  a  continuum  of  care  approach. The Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary (Health), Mission Director (NHM), Director of Health Services of the States/UTs have to ensure proper implementation of the guidelines across India.

## INTRODUCTION

## Non Communicable Diseases:

Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are chronic diseases that are not transmissible from one  person  to  another.  Taking  this  definition  into  account,  NCDs  may  thus  include  wide spectrum of medical disorders both acute and chronic like Cancers, Diabetes, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke, Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKDs), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPDs) and Asthma, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and a gamut of other diseases.

As per WHO, the NCDs are collectively responsible for more than 74 percent of all deaths worldwide including heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. 1 These diseases have public health importance globally and in India. NCDs cause significant morbidity and mortality, both in urban and rural population and across all socio-economic strata, with considerable loss in potentially productive years of life. NCDs are also responsible for  the  maximum out-of-pocket expenditure on health. 2  The economic output lost due to NCDs excluding mental conditions is estimated to be $ 3.55 trillion for India for the period of 2012-2030. 3   Taking cognizance of these facts, Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Target 3.4) aims to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030 in the world. SDG-3 also stresses on prevention and control of tobacco and alcohol use. 4,5 The National Health Policy, 2017 also emphasises the need to halt and reverse the incidence of NCDs and seeks to focus on common NCDs. 6

NCDs are emerging as a major public health challenge worldwide and people above the age of 30 years are most at risk of getting such diseases. India is also experiencing rapid demographic and epidemiological transitions with a steep rise in the burden of lifestyle related chronic NCDs.  With rapid epidemiological transition with higher Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and mortalities, prevention and control measures for NCDs are required to be accelerated to reduce the burden of NCDs in India.

## Burden of Non Communicable Diseases

## Global Scenario:

The global NCD burden remains unacceptably high. NCDs are responsible for 41 million of the world's annual deaths. 17 million of these deaths were premature (30 to 70 years). Burden is greatest within low- and middle-income countries, where 77 percent of all NCD deaths and 80% of premature deaths occurred. 1  Among NCDs, the four top killers that together account

for  more than 80% of all premature NCD deaths annually include cardiovascular diseases (17·9 million), cancers (9.3 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4.1 million), and diabetes (2.0 million). 1

## Indian Scenario:

- As per the WHO - NCD India profile - 2018, NCDs are estimated to account for 63% of all deaths in country of which the cardiovascular diseases lead with 27% overall mortality cause followed by chronic respiratory diseases (11%), cancers (9%), diabetes (3%) and others (13%) (Figure 1). 7
- As per India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative CVD Collaborators - 2016, there were 54.5 million cases of cardiovascular diseases, 23.8 million cases of ischemic heart diseases, 6.5 million cases of stroke, 55 million cases of COPD, 38 million cases of asthma and 65 million  cases  of  diabetes. 8 In  2016,  cardiovascular  diseases  were  responsible  for  28.1 percent deaths, while chronic respiratory diseases contributed to 10.9 percent deaths and cancers contributed to 8.3 percent deaths. 7  Four common NCDs (Cardiovascular Diseases, Cancers, Chronic Respiratory Diseases and Diabetes) account for 23 percent of the total premature mortality in 30-70 years age group. 1
- As per the report of National Cancer Registry Program (2020), the incidence of cancer in India is 13.92 lakhs. Among males, cancers of lung, mouth, oesophagus and stomach are the leading sites across most of the registries. Among females, breast cancer is the commonest cancer followed by cervical cancer. 9

## Risk factors:

Most NCDs are strongly associated with major risk factors such as:

1. Tobacco use (smoking and smokeless)
2. Alcohol use
3. Unhealthy diets
4. Insufficient physical activity
5. Air pollution (indoor and outdoor)

If the above risk factors are not managed/modified, they may lead to the following biological risk factors:

1. Overweight/obesity
2. Raised blood pressure
3. Raised blood sugar
4. Raised total cholesterol/lipids

The other factors due to which an individual might develop NCDs are:

1. Stress
2. Hereditary factors

As  per  National  NCD  Monitoring  Survey  (NNMS),  2017-18,  the  prevalence  of  risk  factors associated  with  NCDs  amongst  adults  (18-69  years)  such  as  current  tobacco  use,  current alcohol use, inadequate intake of fruits and/or vegetables intake and insufficient physical activity are 32.8%, 15.9%, 98.4% and 41.3% respectively in India. 10

However, as per the report of the 2nd round of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS-2) conducted in 2016-2017 among 15 years and above, there are 266.8 million tobacco users in India, i.e., around 28.6 percent of all adults use tobacco in any form (smoking or smokeless). 11

## Evolution  of  National  Programme  for  Prevention  and  Control  of  Non  Communicable Diseases:

Government  of  India  launched  National  Programme  for  Prevention  and  Control  of  Non Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD) erstwhile National Programme for Prevention and Control of  Cancer,  Diabetes,  Cardio-  vascular  Diseases  and  Stroke  (NPCDCS)  in  100  districts  of  21 states to combat NCDs in 2010 as per the 11th Five Year Plan. The rationale was to provide technical, financial and logistics support to the State Governments, and thereby supplement the efforts of the States towards the prevention and control of NCDs. The programme focuses on health promotion, screening, early diagnosis and management of individuals with NCDs along with addressing their risk factors.

During the 12th Five Year Plan, it was proposed to scale up the programme in a phased manner and cover all districts of the country. In 2013-2014, the programme was subsumed under the National Health Mission (NHM) for optimization of resources and provide seamless services to the patients, and for ensuring long term sustainability of the programme interventions. Thus, the  institutionalization  of  the  programme  at  state  level  and  district  level  within  the  State Health Society (SHS) and District Health Society (DHS) respectively, sharing administrative and financial structure of NHM becomes a crucial programme strategy.

NCD  Division  was  established  at  National,  State,  and  District  level  to  ensure  planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the programme activities.

Health facilities were strengthened at different levels for NCD service delivery. The NCD clinics are identified at the district (District Hospital) and Block (Community Health Centre) levels for opportunistic screening, diagnosis and management of common NCDs. Further, Cardiac Care Units and Day Care Centres were set up in selected District Hospitals to provide emergency cardiac care and cancer chemotherapy respectively.

The Population-Based Screening (PBS) of common NCDs as a part of Comprehensive Primary health  Care  (CPHC)  was  initiated  in  2016,  in  selected  districts  across  States/UTs,  and  was scaled up in a phased manner under the programme, and this intervention was scaled-up to cover more district in later stage in a phased manner. With the integration of the programme with  Ayushman  Bharat  -  Health  and  Wellness  Centres,  universal  screening  of  common NCDs was identified as a functionality criterion for primary level facilities to be upgraded as HWCs. The key component of the initiative spanning community level risk assessment using Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC), followed by facility level screening activities and follow up activities towards continuum of care approach were included as an essential service under the Sub Health Centres-Health and Wellness Centres (SHC-HWC) and PHC-HWC and health promotion, management and referral services were strengthened.

There are several newer initiatives that have been included under the programme. From 2016 onwards, the National Multisectoral Action Plan (NMAP) is introduced to offer roadmap and policy options to guide multisectoral efforts involving other Ministries/Departments. 12

There  are  several  other  disease  interventions  such  as  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma, Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD), Stroke, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), which were included in phased manner under the programme. Further, the name of the programme is changed from NPCDCS to National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD).

## Objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs:

The objectives of NP-NCD are as follows:

1. Health  promotion  through  behaviour  change  with  involvement  of  community,  civil society, community-based organizations, media and development partners.
2. Screening, early diagnosis, management, referral and follow-up at each level of healthcare delivery to ensure continuum of care.
3. Build capacity of health care providers at various levels for prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, rehabilitation, IEC/BCC, monitoring and evaluation, and research.
4. Strengthen supply chain management for drugs, equipment and logistics for diagnosis and management at all health care levels.
5. Monitoring, supervision and evaluation of programme through proper implementation of uniform ICT application across India.
6. To  coordinate  and  collaborate  with  other  programmes,  departments/ministries,  civil societies.

This operational guideline for NP-NCD has been developed for policy makers of different levels, the Government officials, NGOs, peripheral health care providers and also other stakeholders with the purpose of providing an understanding of the promotive, preventive and curative approach to reduce morbidity and mortality due to NCDs. The document provides guidance to the programme managers for effective implementation of NCD strategies with purpose of significant improvement of various NCD indicators in the next seven years by 2030. However, the individual States/UTs can prepare the strategic plan according to the NCD situations and socio-demographic profile to achieve state-specific targets.

## NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES - AN OVERVIEW

The common NCDs - Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), Cancers, Diabetes and Chronic Respiratory Diseases, share common modifiable behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and alcohol consumption. Air pollution is also considered as one of the major risk factors for NCDs. These risk factors lead to overweight and obesity, raised blood pressure, raised blood sugar, and raised cholesterol, which in turn can contribute to occurrence of NCDs. A large proportion of NCDs are preventable.

## Hypertension:

Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the arteries of body. Hypertension is abnormally elevated blood pressure. It is a pathological condition in which there is increased workload on cardiovascular system. Blood pressure is measured as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is of two types such as a) Primary or Essential Hypertension and  b)  Secondary  Hypertension.  Hypertension  is  diagnosed  when  the  measured  systolic blood pressure is ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure is ≥90 mmHg on two different occasions.

Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide. An estimated 1.28 billion adults aged 30-79 years have hypertension. Globally, prevalence of hypertension among adult aged 30-79 years is around 33%. 13  Most often hypertension is asymptomatic, however, when blood pressure is very high it may manifest with headache, nasal bleeding, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, fatigue, nausea etc. Hypertension is managed with drugs and maintaining healthy  lifestyle.  Reducing  salt  intake  is  one  of  the  key  interventions  in  management  of hypertension. Hypertension if not controlled for a long time may result into heart attack, stroke, renal failure, retinal damage and other life-threatening conditions.

## Diabetes:

Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body does not produce or properly use the hormone insulin, which is required to convert sugar, starches and other foods into energy. It is classified into three types namely Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes and Gestational Diabetes.

- Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) results from the pancreas failure to produce enough insulin. This form was previously referred to as 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus' (IDDM) or 'Juvenile Diabetes'.
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the commonest type of Diabetes which occurs usually after thirties. It begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses a lack of insulin may also develop. This form was  previously  referred  to  as  'Non-Insulin-Dependent  Diabetes  Mellitus'  (NIDDM)  or 'Adult-onset Diabetes'. Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to lifestyle factors and genetics. The primary cause is excessive body weight and inadequate physical activity.
- Gestational  Diabetes  (GD)  Mellitus  resembles  Type  2  Diabetes  in  several  aspects  but occurs during pregnancy. It occurs in about 2-10% of all pregnancies and may improve or  resolve  after  childbirth.  However,  after  pregnancy  approximately  5-10%  of  women suffering from Gestational Diabetes are found to have Diabetes Mellitus, most commonly type 2. Gestational diabetes is fully treatable but requires careful medical supervision throughout  the  pregnancy.  Management  may  include  dietary  changes,  blood  glucose monitoring, and insulin administration, if needed.
- Pre-diabetes indicates a condition when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of Type 2 DM.

In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and has prevalence of 9% among adults 18 years and above. 14 Over the time the diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes,  kidneys  and  nerves.  Simple  lifestyle  measures  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  in prevention or delaying of diabetes. Early diagnosis can be done through blood sugar testing. Treatment of diabetes includes drugs, diet and physical activity to lower the blood glucose level and reduce the risk factors that can damage blood vessels.

## Cancer:

As per National Cancer Registry Program, the prevalence of cancer is estimated to be around 3.6 million. Nearly 800,000 persons die every year due to cancer in India. 8  The most common cancers are oral cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. Costs of care for cancer treatment are high, and studies show that almost three quarters of cancer expenditure in India is paid out  of  pocket. 8 Cancer  mortality  is  reduced  when  cases  are  detected  and  treated  early. Therefore, screening of common cancers such as oral, breast and cervical was introduced in the programme with the aim to identify individuals with findings suggestive of any cancer or  pre-cancer  before  they  develop  any  symptoms.  Treatment  usually  includes  surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Palliative care is provided for relief rather than to cure the symptoms and suffering caused by cancer and to improve the quality of life of patients.

## Stroke:

India  accounts  for  1.17  million  cases  and  7,00,000  deaths  every  year. 15,16   Community awareness, telemedicine, timely medical intervention and lifestyle modification can prevent most of the stroke events. Increased public literacy in the BE FAST method (Balance Loss, Eyesight Change, Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty and Timely emergency service)  can  significantly  reduce  the  incidence  and  impact  of  stroke.  Stroke  patients  are treated with antiplatelet therapy, thrombolytics and surgery along with physiotherapy. More details are available in Technical Guidelines for Prevention and Management of Stroke. 17

## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):

Conventionally in medical terminology, chronic kidney disease (CKD) means kidney disease persisting for more than 3 months. CKD is progressive in nature (may be very slow at times) and it will ultimately go into End Stage Renal Disease 'ESRD'. Globally, the burden of CKD is approximately over 690 million. 18  In India, the population prevalence of CKD has been shown to be 8-17% in different surveys. 19  Every year about 220,000 new patients of ESRD get added in India resulting in additional demand for 34 million dialysis every year. 20

Diabetes  mellitus,  hypertension,  glomerulonephritis  and  tubulo-interstitial  diseases  are the most common causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). For people at risk of CKD, it is important to abstain from smoking and alcohol consumption, focus on weight control, salt restriction and physical activities. Haemodialysis and Peritoneal dialysis are major modes of treatment for patients with ESRD. More details are available in Operational Guidelines for Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme and Peritoneal Dialysis 20  and Medical Officer's Manual for Prevention and Management of Chronic Kidney Diseases. 21

## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma:

Common  chronic  respiratory  diseases  are  COPD,  asthma,  occupational  lung  diseases, interstitial lung disease. Among them, COPD and asthma are major public health problems, contributing to 251 million and 388 million cases respectively worldwide in 2016 and 3.17 million  and  0.39  million  deaths  respectively  in  2015  (i.e.,  both  caused  &gt;5%  of  all  deaths globally). Chronic respiratory diseases resulted in 10.9% of all deaths in India. 22 Tobacco use,

<!-- image -->

air pollution, allergen, occupational agents, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity are few of the risk factors. Early detection, management, appropriate referral, and continuum of care for COPD and asthma patients under the NP-NCD programme is envisioned. Awareness for indoor air pollution should be the main priority. As tobacco cessation has been demonstrated to  reduce  mortality,  every  patient  at  every  visit  would  be  asked  about  their  tobacco  use status. Spirometry is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis. Patients are managed with medications such as bronchodilators, steroids, or combinations, etc. More details are available in Medical Officer's Manual for Prevention and Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Asthma. 23

## Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD):

Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the build-up of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused due to alcohol consumption. It is estimated to afflict approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Various epidemiological studies from India suggest prevalence of NAFLD around 9% - 32% of the general population in India. 24 Obesity and Diabetes are the major risk factors for NAFLD. NAFLD interventions have been included within the broad structure of NP-NCD to  guide  a  range  of  strategies  including  health  promotion  activities  which  are  crucial  to prevent NAFLD. An Operational Guidelines for the Integration of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) into NPCDCS 24  was developed and disseminated to enhance the capacity of the program managers at the state, district and sub- district level, to operationalize the introduction of NAFLD interventions under the overall ambit of NP-NCD programme.

## ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI):

It is estimated that about 28.1% people die due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in India. Further, Ischemic Heart Diseases and Strokes account for 80% of all CVDs. Contribution of CVDs to Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) is also highest at 14.1%, including 8.7% DALYs caused by ischemic heart diseases alone .25 Myocardial Infarctions (MI) are clinically classified into ST elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI), based on changes in ECG. STEMI accounts for about 40% of Myocardial Infarctions. Risk factors of MI include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet and excessive alcohol intake, among others. It is estimated that STEMIs occurs about twice more often in men than in women.

For STEMI, timely intervention is critical in order to save lives by restoring blood flow to the heart. Therefore, interventions such as thrombolysis and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)  are  required  to  be  done  in  the  shortest  possible  time.  More  details  are  available  in Guidelines for Management of ST- Elevated Myocardial Infarction. 25

## ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF NP-NCD

The  response  of  Government  of  India  to  NCD  has  been  robust  and  aligned  with  political declaration conveyed in the high-level meeting on the prevention and control of NCDs at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011, 2014 and 2018.

The National Health Policy, which was published in 2017, recognized the need to halt and reverse the growing incidence of chronic diseases. It has supported an integrated approach where screening of the most prevalent NCDs with secondary prevention would make impact on reduction of morbidity and mortality. Also, it would be incorporated into comprehensive primary healthcare with linkages to specialist consultation and follow-up at the primary level.

The NP-NCD Programme has been expanded to cover the entire country. The integration of services at district level and below has been brought under the umbrella of National Health Mission.

## OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES

## Service delivery mechanism under NP-NCD

Service delivery framework consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and supportive services (core and integrated services) for common NCDs are being provided through various levels of government health facilities. Government of India's flagship programme of Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB -HWCs) has clearly laid out the activities covered across level of primary care i.e., HWCPHC/UPHC, HWC-SHC and community.  The secondary level facilities such as CHC/SDH and DH are  also  now  being  strengthened  to  respond  to  the  growing  burden  of  NCDs,  and  to function as the referral linkages for facilities below this level of care.

The range of NCD services includes health promotion, psycho-social counselling, screening, case management (out-and-in-patient), emergency cardiac and stroke care services, day care and palliative care services for cancer, as well as referral for specialized services, as needed.

Bi-directional referral linkages covering all levels of health care facilities shall be established to assure care both for NCDs and associated unforeseen emergencies and follow up care. Whenever feasible and appropriate, teleconsultation services with higher centres would be organized.

As needed, referral to specialists at the secondary or tertiary level is to be ensured.  Such referrals  shall  be  with  specific  instructions  regarding  facility  name  and  location,  day  and time of visit, person to contact etc. Two-way referrals between various facility levels are to be ensured, which can be facilitated through established IT system or teleconsultation. The loop between the primary care medical provider and the specialist must be closed. This can be achieved when the specialists at district facility or higher are able to communicate to the medical officer about the adequacy of treatment, any change in treatment plans, and further referral action.

## Package of services

## Activities and interventions at various levels:

- i. Individual/family/community level:
- a) Active enumeration of the eligible population and registration of families and maintenance of family folder which is done by ASHA.
- b) Risk assessment using Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) for all individuals:

Through  CBAC  administration,  a  scoring  is  done  for  individuals,  which  is  not  a  point of  elimination  but  a  means  to  highlight  risk  factors  of  NCDs  and  for  customization  of health promotional activities and prioritizing for screening. CBAC form, which is used for community-based assessment, is placed as Annexure 2 , along with reporting formats for various levels of public health facilities under NP-NCD.

- c) Health promotion  through  appropriate  and  effective  Information  Education  and Communication (IEC) and BCC strategies with special emphasis on prevention of NCDs and healthy lifestyle. Wellness activities including Yoga and integration with intervention like Fit India movement and Eat Right movement at the level of community.
- d) Educating  community  about  healthy  lifestyles.  Family-centric  care  for  sustainable acceptance of healthy lifestyle and ensuring treatment adherence.
- e) Community level forum like Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC)/ Mahila Aaarogya Samiti (MAS), Jan Aarogya Samiti (JAS), Self Help Groups (SHG) and local bodies in both rural and urban areas to be strengthened and established as a platform for community awareness and promotive and preventive care activities.
- f) Frontline workers, ASHA, Multiple Purpose Worker/Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (MPW/ANM) to be skilled for Primary, basic diagnostic and community level preventive care for NCD related problems.
- g) Community follow up of identified individuals to be carried out by ASHA making visits for behavioural changes, treatment compliances, and encouraging patients to go to the HWCs for regular check-up of BP/blood glucose.
- h) Counselling and appropriate referral of patients requiring medical interventions. ASHA would administer Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) for all individuals of 30 years and above age group in the population. Through CBAC administration, a scoring is done for individuals, which is not a point of elimination but a score of 4 or more implies high risk. In addition, the tool includes questions related to symptoms of cervical cancer, breast cancer, oral cancer and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma. All the identified individuals of age 30 years and above are referred for screening of common NCDs.

## ii. SHC-HWC/U-HWC:

The following activities are carried out at the level of Sub Health Centre - Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):

## a) Health promotion:

Behaviour and life-style changes through health promotion is an important component of the programme at sub centre/SC -HWC level and to be carried out by the frontline health workers, ANMs  and/or  Multi-Purpose  Worker  (MPW)  -  Male/Female  and  Community  Health  Officer (CHO) for all age groups (preferably 18 years and above). Various approaches can be used such as organising camps, interpersonal communication (IPC), posters, banners, billboards, etc. to educate people at community/school/workplace settings. Health Promotion activities can be carried out at the community level during the Village/Urban Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Days (VHSND)/ Community based platforms and/or outreach activities including Annual Health calendar activities. Forty-two health calendar days are celebrated by each ABHWCs apart from wellness-related activities like Yoga, Zumba, Meditation etc., which not only enable improved physical health but also mental wellbeing of the community. The health workers can discuss the various aspects of a healthy lifestyle and its benefits with the target groups, mobilise the community to get screened at nearest HWCs and motivate them to adopt a healthy lifestyle for prevention of common NCDs.

## b) NCD screening activities:

Under CPHC, HWCs are functioning as the first point of contact for screening of NCDs and risk  factors.  Community  Health  Officers  (CHO)  would  provide  primary  level  care  at  the Health and Wellness Centres but a dedicated Medical Officer (MO) is posted at Urban HWCs (UHWCs) to undertake activities related to NCDs. The MO will screen NCDs along with primary management of conditions, following treatment protocols.

At the HWC level in rural areas, the CHOs and associated team (ANMs/MPWs) would be trained to undertake screening for HTN, DM, CRDs CA etc., thus enabling early identification, timely detection, and appropriate referral, if needed.

HWC team maintains a record of NCD patients in general OPD, camps and their subsequent referral to higher centres. The CHOs should be alert for the possibility of complications among the NCD patients.

## c) Referral and Follow up:

The suspected cases for NCDs are referred to higher health facilities for further diagnosis, treatment initiation and management. The suspected cancer cases are referred to PHC / CHC /  District  Hospital  for  confirmation.  The  AB-HWCs  provide  teleconsultation  services  using e-Sanjeevani platform, whereby every level of service provider from CHO to medical officer can  access  higher  level  consultation,  including  with  specialists  in  secondary  and  tertiary centres.

## d) Drugs and Logistics Supply:

Medicines listed as per essential list of medicines for public health care facilities need to be ensured at respective facility. At least one month supply of medicine should be provided to the patients. Accordingly, one month medicine needs to be maintained as per patient load at the facility. The drug status is recorded by the CHO/ ANM/ MPW while dispensing the medicine.

<!-- image -->

For a patient suspected of a chronic disease, confirmation and initiation of treatment will be by the MBBS Medical Officer at the PHC or a higher referral centre. However, for continuation of treatment, medicines will be dispensed at SHC-HWCs by CHO to avoid patient hardship and ensure that the clinical condition is monitored regularly.

Any  uncontrolled  condition  must  be  referred  to  MO  for  necessary  management.  CHO/ ANM/ MPW is undertaking the monitoring of the patients and then issue the next month's supply.Patients would be encouraged to come to the HWC so that their health status can be monitored. Home based distribution is recommended only for patients who are not able to travel.

## e) Data recording and reporting:

## India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI):

The  India  Hypertension  Control  Initiative  (IHCI)  is  a  multi-partner  initiative  between  the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Indian Council of Medical Research, State Governments, World Health Organisation-India and Resolve to Save Lives (Technical Partner). The initiative aimed to accelerate progress towards the Government of India's NCD targets by supporting evidence-based strategies for strengthening the building blocks of hypertension management and control. IHCI was launched in November 2017 and was implemented in 25 districts across 5  States  (Punjab,  Kerala,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Telangana  and  Maharashtra)  in  first  year.  The initiative included a Simple Application with following features: 1) Scanning of QR Code of Health ID Card for beneficiary identification. 2) Observe the progress rate of the Programme through a) number of patients on treatment and b) control rate. 3) Follow-up of beneficiaries through Call/SMS.and 4) Cohort monitoring to track a set of patients receiving treatment over a time.

Based on the positive experiences and lessons learnt from the IHCI sites, and the existing initiatives of MoHFW on prevention, screening and control of common NCDs since 2016 and CPHC rollout in 2018, Government of India has now decided to merge the simple application of IHCI with National NCD Portal to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure maximum utilisation of existing resources. A compilation of good practices under IHCI is placed as Annexure 3.

## Centre of Excellence :

Centre of Excellence (preferably disease specific) needs to be established at State/National level. The activities may be planned as follows:

- Designing of training manuals
- Capacity building of master trainers
- Implementation of NP NCD Operational Guidelines/National Disease Specific Guidelines

## HRH management and processes:

## Recruitment:

While the planning for NCD services lies in the domain of NCD unit, the overall assessment of HRH requirements and its planning is to be done in consultation with the HRH nodal and finalized by Mission Director NHM. Thereafter, the overall responsibility for HRH recruitment and their management, including salary disbursal and timely payment, should remain with the HRH cell in the State.

In case of vacancies at the State, District, or Sub-district level, the NCD cell should inform the Mission Director as well as the HRH cell about the vacancies. HRH cell should then complete the recruitment as soon as possible. However, the NCD cell should have a say in the decisions regarding the recruitment of the PMU staff. Once hired, the NCD cell should provide an indepth orientation of the program (which is over and above any generic orientation), build the  capacities  to  meet  the  program  needs,  provide  mentoring  support,  and  monitor  the performance.

## Performance Monitoring:

It  is  a  good  practice  to  keep  an  eye  on  the  performance of the HRH and reward the good performers. It promotes ways to enhance productivity along with quality. In this direction, MoHFW  has  issued  Minimum  Performance  Benchmarks  for  all  HRH,  especially  the  HRH looking after program management. The NCD division in consultation with the HRH division should review, and if need be, revise the benchmarks and monitor the performance.

<!-- image -->

## Dos and Don'ts in HRH:

## Dos:

- The g uidelines from MoHFW are suggestive which the States/UTs need to adopt and adapt as their context.
- The focus of any resource including HRH has to be shifted from mere inputs to output and in the longer term to outcomes and impact.
- Restructure current Program Management Units at various levels to optimize resources, achieve better cohesion and coordination and deliver person-centered care.
- All HRH under all the programs in the State/UT under NHM to be governed by the same set of rules e.g., increment, periodic performance monitoring.
- Salaries of the HRH, both service delivery and program management, are to be based on educational qualifications, experience, skills, and workload. It should be the same for similar profiles.
- Encourage cross-divisional learning and joint monitoring between programs and major disease groups which are related.
- Prepare Terms of reference (including Job responsibilities and person specifications) for all the posts and communicate these to the HRH/incumbent.
- HRH under NHM would be governed by the HRH policy of the State. For guidance, one may refer to 'Guidelines for NHM HRH 2022' available in the public domain at: https:// nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/fil es/2022-04/Final Guideline on Human Resources for Health for NHM.pdf

## Don'ts:

- Do not disrupt any process/unit which is functional. Any change could be incremental. No necessary work should be stopped to start a new process or structure. Similarly, HRH already in place should not be discontinued (except for reasons of loss of relevance or duplication) in order to embrace a new structure. The vacant posts could be eliminated if required for restructuring.
- Do  not  create  any  standalone  programmatic  posts  with  narrow  task  profiles.  Try integrating services and fun ctions for the betterment of the system.

Details of HR supported under NP-NCD program is placed as Annexure 4.

## COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES

A  strategic  and  integrated  communication  approach  for  NP-NCD  is  essential  to  help communities  identify  risk  factors,  motivate  them  to  adopt  and  maintain  health  seeking behaviours  and  practices,  address  misconceptions  and  fears,  identify  and  mitigate  risk factors, motivate for lifestyle modifications and usage of available NCD services. The most appropriate communication approaches, methods or channels should be developed based on evidence in order to achieve the national goal of creating 'Swasthya Nagrik Abhiyan' a social movement for health.

Communication strategy must aim at creating an enabling environment in which high uptake of NCD services is achieved. Enabling the environment means there is positive support and discourse for achieving health goals. An enabling environment generates confidence in the NCD services being provided, and the uptake of health behaviours and practices.

## National Health Policy 2017:

The  National  Health  Policy  2017  articulates  to  institutionalize  inter-sectoral  coordination at  national  and  sub-national  levels  to  optimize  health  outcomes,  through  constitution  of bodies that have representation from relevant non-health ministries. This is in line with the emergence 'Health in All' approach as complement to Health for All. The policy identifies coordinated action on priority areas for improving the environment for health by promotion of balanced, healthy diets, regular exercise, addressing tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse, air pollution, reduce stress and improve safety in workplace pertaining to Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs).

The  National  Health  Policy  2017  envisions  the  need  for  development  for  strategies  and institutional mechanism in each of the priority area to create 'Swasthya Nagrik Abhiyan' a social movement for health.

The  policy  focuses  on  collaborating  with  Non-Government  Sector  and  engagement  with private  sector  for  specialized  services.  The  policy  advocates  a  positive  and  proactive engagement with the private sector for filling critical gap toward achieving national goals.

## Key Objectives:

To achieve the above goal, key communication objectives are:

- Increasing awareness among the population to help identify risk factors, maintain healthy behaviours and practices, address misconceptions and fears.
- Behavioural change communication (BCC) for promotion of healthy life.
- Generating demand of NCD services at different levels.
- Self-care management and treatment adherence.

<!-- image -->

## Key Strategies:

The communication activities to achieve these two objectives are broadly divided under the following key strategies, although they are closely linked to each other:

- Advocacy (Policy Advocacy, Program Advocacy, Media Advocacy)
- Communication (news media, entertainment, infotainment, print media, IPC)
- Social Mobilization
- Social Media
- Setting based approach
- Capacity Building and Training
- Innovations

## A. Advocacy:

Advocacy refers to activities that seek to influence the decision makers to make NCDs core to public health agenda and create an enabling environment in support of NCDs. Advocacy fosters  political  will,  increases  financial  and  other  resources  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and holds authorities accountable to ensure that pledges are fulfilled, and results achieved. It's a  coordinated  efforts  designed  to  place  NCDs  higher  on  the  political  agenda,  strengthen government commitment and increase financial resources for NCDs. It can be defined under these categories:

- a) Policy advocacy works with senior politicians and administrators on the impact of the issue at the national level and the need for action. Policy advocacy lobbies with national or local political leadership and administrators to increase funding for NCDs programs and formulate policy accordingly.
- b) Program advocacy reaches out to decision-makers, stakeholders and community partners to boost their participation in actions and program decisions in support of NCDs services. Program advocacy is used at the local community level to convince opinion leaders about the need for local action and generating demand.
- c) Media  advocacy puts  NCDs  issues  on  the  public  agenda  to  generate  support  from governments and donors and validate the relevance of a subject. It encourages the media to cover NCDs related issues regularly and in a responsible manner to raise awareness. In  the  process,  media  advocacy  helps  in  creating  a  more  favo urable  environment  for individual and community action to control NCDs.

## B. Communication:

Communication is a process people use to exchange information about NCDs through media, including a combination of communication channels such as mass media, mid-media, and interpersonal communication (IPC). Most of the communication effort on NCDs is concerned with transmitting a series of messages to the people affected by NCDs through mass media and  mid-media,  which  are  necessary  but  not  sufficient.  Participation'  and  Dialogue'  are required for effective communication where participatory or interpersonal communication (IPC) occupies the place. Communication may be categorized into following sub-groups:

- a)  M ass media includes channels and campaigns that reach a general audience or a larger target group, such as print, radio or television campaigns, Internet websites, and special events. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) campaigns often fall into this category but can target smaller audiences as well.
- b) Mid  media  uses  more  targeted  channels,  like  brochures,  posters,  mobile  phones, photography, video, street theatre, and testimonials, to reach specific groups. These are often referred to as information, education, and communication (IEC) approaches.
- c) Interpersonal communication (IPC) includes counselling, one-on-one education sessions, skills trainings, and presentations often targeted at health workers/ community health worker/ Rogi Kalyan Samiti mem ber/ Jan Arogya Samiti member/ and direct supporters of NCD patients and families.

## C. Social mobilization:

Social mobilization is the process of bringing together different stakeholders and building partnerships to prevent, diagnose and manage NCDs and creating demand of NCDs related services. It targets different stakeholders of the targeted population, i.e. a village community, a ward, or other small groups. Social mobilization aims to:

- a) I ncrease awareness about NCDs, promoting healthy life and demand for diagnosis and treatment services.
- b) Expand service delivery through community-based approaches including formation of patients support groups.
- c) Enhance sustainability, accountability, and community ownership of NCD services.

In our response in prevention and control of NCDs, the program division visualizes two social mobilization strategies to mobilize community: one is Advocacy, Communication, Partnership and Social Mobilization (NCDNet) and other is Advocacy and Network with People Living with NCDs (PLNCDs).

## Advocacy, Communication, Partnership and Social Mobilization:

Advocacy and cross-sector partnership may be need of the hour to enhance and accelerate sustainable engagement of stakeholders working on NCDs to create necessary awareness and help in promotion of healthy lifestyle to reduce the burden. Further, the National Health Policy  2017  advocates  for  collaborating  with  non-government  sector  or  engagement  with private sector for specialized services in pursuit of achieving the SDGs target.

Ministry of Health &amp; Family welfare has already taken a lead in devising National Multi-sectoral Action Plan (NMAP) for NCDs brining 39 government ministries together to combat emergence of NCDs, reduce the risk factors and promote healthy lifestyle23. The proposed consortium of advocacy and partnership network might be known as NCD Network India which could be supported by other Department/Ministry, international and national organizations. This consortium can play a vital role in promoting healthy lifestyle and help in increasing health literacy to get better outcome and reducing risk factors of NCDs.

## Advocacy and Network with People Living with NCDs:

People  living  with  NCDs  are  powerful  agents  of  change,  capable  of  leveraging  their  lived experience to reach others and help break down stigma and discrimination. Equipped with skills,  networks  and  knowledge,  they  are  active  players  in  the  response  to  NCDs  at  both individual and system levels. Some of the following objectives of this network may be as under:

- Discuss, evolve and define what is meant by 'meaningful involvement' of people living with NCDs and compile and share a repository of good practices relating to the meaningful involvement of people living with NCDs.
- Draw out lessons learned from other social movements in the meaningful involvement of people directly affected by an issue, such as: HIV/AIDS, Polio, Covid, etc.
- Discuss strategies for furthering the Advocacy Agenda of People Living with NCDs and advocating meaningful involvement in national, regional, district and sub-district levels.
- Provide a space for discussions between key stakeholders interested in exploring and promoting the meaningful participation of people living with NCDs, distilling how they can contribute.
- Rogi Kalyan Samiti (RKS) and Ja n Arogya Samiti (JAS) can play a critical role.

## D. Social Media Strategies for NCDs:

Social media is defined as platforms that connect people online based on a common topic or goal. This definition focuses on the connection between people and the sharing of information through text, photos, or videos or info graphics. The popularity of social media lies in its accessibility: It is easy to use and is generally free. With the potential for people to connect, express, learn, engage, and act with the simple push of a button, the power of social media is undeniable. There is low or no monetary investment involved aside from users' time. And the potential for increasing reach of messaging is impressive. Social media provide implementers the ability to reach a large number of people over a broad geographic area with minimum human and financial resources.

In resource-limited settings, bandwidth is increasing, and internet access is becoming more widely available, especially through mobile devices. Therefore, the pool of potential reach is extremely large, and users have the ability to really engage on a meaningful level. On the other hand, traditional media is often costly, has limited reach, is extremely time-consuming, and is often based on one-way communication.

Social  media  offers  significant  opportunities  to  enhance  their  engagement  in  community dialogue, contribute to ongoing problem-solving, recognize the work of partner organizations, and  help  improve  mass  media  coverage  of  global  health  issues.  Social  media  can  be  an addition  to  traditional  media  methods  (television,  print  media,  billboards,  etc.),  further expanding the reach and reinforcement of critical health messages.

The  popular  platforms  of  social  media  such  as  Facebook,  Twitter,  WhatsApp,  Instagram, YouTube  and  LinkedIn  can  be  used  to  generate  positive  conversations  around  NCDs  and benefits of healthy behavioural practices. A proactive and sustained strategy may be used for sharing positive messages around the disease(s) burden, their risk factors, diagnosis and management. Outreach can be done through existing handles of MoHFW on different social media platforms and website of MoHFW, PIB and partners. Separate handles may be created apart  from  official  handles  of  MoHFW  on  different  social  media  platforms.  Monitoring  of negative conversation, myths, rumours in social media can be done regularly and positive content may be shared on regular intervals to counter and dissolve these through seeding of positive and scientific information on NCDs.

## E. Setting Based Approach for Health Promotion:

A setting is where people actively use and shape the environment; thus, it is also where people create or solve problems relating to health. Settings can normally be identified as having physical boundaries, a range of people with defined roles, and an organizational structure. This may be at school, workplace, home, cities, villages etc.

<!-- image -->

Action to promote health through different settings can take many forms. Actions often involve some level of organizational development, including changes to the physical environment or  to  the  organizational  structure,  administration  and  management.  Settings  can  also  be used to promote health as they are vehicles to reach individuals, to gain access to services, and to synergistically bring together the interactions throughout the wider community. The following settings may be considered as under:

- Health Promoting Schools
- Health Promoting Institutions
- Health Promoting Cities
- Health Promoting Workplace
- Health Promoting Hospitals
- Health Promoting Villages
- Health Promoting Home
- Health Promoting Market
- Health Pr omoting municipalities/communities

All  these  efforts  needed  multisectoral  coordination  at  State  and  District  levels  in  order  to smoothly  implement  these  strategies  and  seek  desired  change  to  meet  the  objective  to prevent and control NCDs in the country and meet the sustainable development by 2030. Modalities for implementing such interventions may be developed separately.

## F. Innovative Strategies:

Innovation  in  health  promotion  can  be  defined  as  invention  +  adoption  +  diffusion.  Any developments, simple or complex, that lead to improvements in health outcomes and patient experiences are healthcare innovations. In healthcare, it may be a novel idea, product, service or care pathway that has clear benefits when compared to what is currently done. Successful innovations often possess two key qualities: they are both usable and desirable.

There are many health promotion innovations that could benefit the health care sector and assist in the continuity of care across the health care delivery system. It is up to primary stake holder  how  to  embrace  the  idea  of  change  through  innovations  and  make  a  determined effort to realise the desire change. Culture of innovation offers the potential of greater impact on  continuum  of  health  care  with  lesser  resources.  It's  needed  to  make  sure  to  address issues of regulation, scalability and establishing partnership with other stakeholders while implementing those innovations on the ground.

The National NCD Division has envisioned some of the innovative health promotion ideas in  order  to  address  risk  factors  of  NCDs,  their  prevention,  knowledge  sharing  to  better outcome, motivating health seeking behaviour within community at large. Few examples are Observance of NCD Week/Fortnight, mHealth, K4Health, Plant a Tree Campaign, etc. which may help in knowledge sharing, accessing appropriate information and motivating for leading a healthy life for prevention and control of NCDs to continue delivering universal healthcare to the population at large.

<!-- image -->

## · Observance of NCD Week/Fortnightly (Swasth Nagrik Saptah/Pakhwara):

Observance of Special week/fortnight always draws attention of common people and gives a  platform  to  increase  awareness  regarding  NCDs  risk  factors,  their  prevention,  diagnosis and management. The proposed observance of NCD Week/Fortnight (Swasth Nagrik Saptah/ Pakhwara) will provide a platform to deliver NCDs related services with special attention. This NCD Week/Fortnight may start from World Stroke Day i.e., 29th October to World Diabetes Day i.e., 14th November every year to create awareness about NCD risk factors, screening of common NCDs, their management, prevention of NCDs and promotion of adoption of healthy lifestyle. The following activities may be proposed to observe Swasth Nagrik Saptah:

- Population  based  screening  for  common  cancer  may  be  intensified  and  organized  in camp wise at all CHCs across the country.
- Observance of World Stroke Day i.e., 29th October, National Cancer Awareness Day i.e., 7th November and World Diabetes Day i.e., 14th November every year.
- Awareness at district and sub-district level may be organized.
- Inter-personal communication may be used extensively for creating necessary awareness. NCDNet  network  and  PLNCDs  network  may  also  be  used  for  effective  community engagement program.
- National Service Scheme (NSS)/National Cadet Corps (NCC), NehruYuva Kendra (NYK), Local Youth Clubs and Rogi Kalyan Samiti (RKS) at CHC and Jan Arogya Samiti (JAS) at HWC may be integrated to engage local community in observance.
- Integration/convergence  with  other  national  programs  (oral  health,  mental  health, elderly, blindness control, etc.) for effective implementation of awareness campaign on NCDs
- Calend ar of activities must be prepared for observance of NCDs week.

Special camps on population-based screening for common cancer may be organized in all Tertiary  Cancer  Care  Centre  (TCCC),  State  Cancer  Institute  (SCI)  supported  under  NP-NCD program. Efforts may be made to realize this in CNCI, Kolkata and NCI, Jhajjar too for the observance  of  NCD  Week/Fortnight  along  with  community  mobilization  and  outreach activities near their neighbouring area.

Special efforts may be made to organize such events in government of India medical colleges including AIIMS, PGIs. States/UTs governments may organize such events in their respective medical colleges to observe NCD Week/Fortnight. It will create a buzz in media as well as help in creating necessary awareness about NCDs and their prevention.

## · Knowledge for Health for NCDs:

We all need up to date information to do our jobs better.  If the information is not appropriate or misleading or not communicated accurately, it can lead to health consequences. Imagine a world where all health professionals regardless of geographical locations and resources can access the knowledge to improve their health knowledge and help in saving lives.

Knowledge for Health envisage sharing evidence-based knowledge about latest information or success stories/best practices on health, in which health programme managers and service providers at all levels across the stakeholders collaborate with and learn from each other to build a stronger health system and enable people to access appropriate information.

<!-- image -->

Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has set up National Health Portal (NHP) in pursuance to decision of National Knowledge Commission to provide healthcare related  information  to  people  and  to  serve  a  single  point  of  access  for  consolidated information. Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) has been established for managing National Health Portal.  We may propose certain action plans which need to be taken care under this Knowledge for Health intervention.

- National Health Portal is a good example of Knowledge for Health but limited to National level interventions. Success stories from states which have been represented in National Summit on Good and Replicable Services and Innovations in Public Healthcare System may also be incorporated for wider public access.
- A separate dedicated website of NP-NCD should be created for wider public interface with all the latest updates. It should be made a comprehensive platform and all IEC materials/ innovations/ best practices should be made available for all stakeholders. The proposed website may be named as www.ncdindia.gov.in for public interface and wider recognition and branding.
- Sharing best practice for prevention and control of NCDs especially from middle- and low-income countries for referen ces and wider adoption and replication in States/UTs.

## TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING

The  successful  implementation  of  NP-NCD  would  largely  depend  upon  the  quality  of training conducted for all levels of health functionaries. Health-care providers are not only responsible for rolling out the various components of the programme but are also a major source  of  information  for  the  community.  A  good  training  gives  confidence  to  the  health workers and thus all sessions must be interactive and use the adult learning methodology depending on the cadre of participants. The training would be imparted through classroom teaching using participatory methods including case studies and field practice. The training would  also  include  practical  sessions  in  addition  to  interactive  lectures  and  discussions, PowerPoint  presentations,  role  plays,  exercises,  case  studies  and  interactive  discussions. Each  batch  should  not  have  more  than  40  participants.  The  number  of  batches  is  to  be planned according to the number of different health staff engaged in the district. Under NCD programmes, training modules have been developed for different cadre of service providers and  programme  managers  and  the  trainings  should  be  provided  in  accordance  with  the content and relevance with each cadre.

Health-care  personnel  who  require  training  include  District  NCD  Programme  Officers (DNPOs),  Medical  officers  (MOs),  Community  Health  Officers  (CHOs),  data  managers  and frontline health workers and their supervisors. The ASHAs are also to be oriented for effective community mobilization. In addition, plans should be drawn up to orient the relevant faculty of departments in medical colleges as well as professional bodies (IAP, IMA) involved in NCD prevention and management. It is important to train not only the newly recruited staff, but also those who are already on the job regarding updated/ new guidelines/ activities under the programme. Key areas of training under the programme are NCD prevention, early detection and  management  of  common  NCDs,  data  recording  and  reporting,  health  promotion, planning,  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Effective  implementation  of  a programme also requires the programme managers to be adequately equipped with skills to efficiently monitor and guide implementation of the programme at all levels of health care.

## Training approach:

Cascaded training  is  envisaged  for  building  capacity  of  all  cadres  of  staff  involved  in  NPNCD. Each state is expected to conduct State ToT workshops for District level Nodal officers. Subsequently, the district level nodal officers will conduct district-level training and block level  trainings.  As  per  the  programme  need,  the  trainings  with  respect  to  programme implementation and disease specific will be conducted for healthcare provider separately or combinedly at all levels of healthcare delivery.

<!-- image -->

Apart  from  the  one-time  training  and  orientation  as  described  above  every  opportunity should be utilized for sensitization of different cadres on NP-NCD.

The following mechanism as few examples to orient different cadres of health functionaries apart from regular trainings:

- Supportive supervisory or on the job training visits to the health care centres or partners.
- Review meeting at the block level/district level held every monthly or quarterly.
- Refresher trainings for front line workers/ CHOs/ MOs. Newer modalities like virtual trainings using digital platforms like echo, webex, etc.
- Self-learning trainings using learning management information systems.

## Specialised training :

Specialized clinical training for Cardiac care, Stroke care, Cancer Care, CKD, COPD and asthma and NAFLD etc. for the Medical and Para-medical staff for District Hospital and below could be conducted. Specialised clinical hands-on training (e.g., VIA technique/Chemotherapy for Cancer Care, STEMI, Emergency Cardiac/Stroke care training, etc.) could be conducted at the designated centres in respective States. Medical colleges, Nursing colleges, District Skill Labs etc., can be leveraged.

## List of training materials:

- Programme  specific  guidelines  and  available  training  material/handbooks  including standard treatment guidelines
- User manuals of various IT applications under NPCDCS
- Projector/LCD, screen, laptop/computer, and other audio-visual aids
- White board with marker pens/flip charts with tripod stands
- Revised CBAC checklist
- Job aids
- Communication materials
- Attendance sheet
- Pre and post assessment questionaries, feedback forms
- Active internet connection
- Fully functional skill lab
- Clinical an d public health scenarios for skilling on problem solving

Detailed table depicting training plan for various components under NP-NCD is  placed  as Annexure 5.

## MONITORING, SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION

Programme  monitoring  and  evaluation  cycle  requires  identification  of  national  and  subnational level of indicators that measures inputs, process, outputs, outcomes and impact.

There are four components of programme monitoring and evaluation cycle:

1. Programme monitoring - Data collection, performance management and data quality assurance
2. Evaluation - Use of data for decision making, rapid assessment of program effectiveness and impact
3. Learning- Documentation, reporting and dissemination of findings/learning
4. Planning- Defining indicators and data source

The designated NP-NCD programme management unit at national, state and district level would be responsible for the above components of programme monitoring and evaluation cycle.

## Data flow mechanism under NP-NCD:

## For opportunistic screening

<!-- image -->

Figure 4: Data flow mechanism under NP-NCD

<!-- image -->

Since,  National  NCD  portal  maintained  line  listing  data  to  ensure  continnum  of  care.  The monthly reports are generated directly from the portal, viewed and shared electronically. This monthly report should be used for monitoring and supervision in the field. The State/ facilities where National NCD portal is not functional the manual reporting may be submitted to their hierarchy. The formats are placed at Annexure 6.

## Population based screening:

Data from Population Based Screening is coming from the following three sources:

## National NCD portal:

National NCD Portal assists the healthcare providers and managers in service delivery and monitoring of Population Based Screening (PBS) for Non Communicable diseases (NCDs) at all levels (National, State, District, Block, PHC and Sub Centre level). The software addressed key issues of making Electronic Health Record (EHR), standardizing the recording and reporting system, creating unique personal health ID, streamlined the upward and downward referrals across health facilities, tracking follow-up, preparation of work plan for the health personnel and digitizing health record for every individual. The NCD application has also automated, referral management of NCDs.

The system enables population enumeration, risk assessment and screening of the entire population  and  collects  information  on  risk  factors  for  NCDs  for  30+  population  and management and follow up of those found to be diagnosed with any of the five NCDs. The system is used by health workers and mid-level health providers at Sub-Health centres and doctors and Nurses at Primary Health Centre. The programme managers at district, state and national level regularly access the dashboards to seek implementation insights. Community health workers, nurses, doctors, and programme managers can use these applications on devices like phones, tablets, or computers.

## Non-CommunicableDiseases Screening&amp;Management

Figure 5: Six Applications in National NCD Portal

<!-- image -->

The National NCD Portal is a suite of 6 applications:

- 1) ASHA Mobile App - To capture Population enumeration and CBAC Assessment
- 2) HWC App To screen the population for five common NCDs and enable referrals to PHC by ANM/CHO at the SHC, HWCs
- 3) PHC Web Portal and App To validate patient screening, complete diagnosis/ manage/ refer to higher centres by MO in PHC and backward referrals for follow-ups. Mobile app version is about to be launched for the same.
- 4) CHC/DH Portal and App To confirm diagnosis of patients referred from PHCs and initiate treatment and backward referrals.
- 5) Admin Portal To manage the master data for facility and users at district and state levels.
- 6) Health Officials Dashboard Dashboard for district, State and National NCD officials to monitor the status of programme implementation and NCD indicators.

The  National  NCD  Portal  is  integrated  with  Ayushman  Bharat  Digital  Mission  (ABDM),  to enable creation of ABHA Health IDs and linking of existing Health IDs in National NCD Portal. The  National  NCD  Portal  is  also  integrated  with  Ayushman  Bharat  Health  and  Wellness Centre Portal (AB-HWC) to update NCD facility data with HWC information and to populate NCD Indicators into HWC Service Delivery Format. Details on good practices of CDSS wrt to National NCD Portal is placed as Annexure 7 .

Further, the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) was developed in the form of medical officer  module  and  integrated  with  the  current  National  NCD  Portal.  The  CDSS  enabled National  NCD  Portal  analyses  the  data  captured  by  healthcare  providers  and  generates guideline-based advisories to provide evidence-based care for diabetes and hypertension

<!-- image -->

in  accordance with the level of health facility i.e., where MO IC is posted. The workflow is described in the figure below.

Figure 6: Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) Integrated Patient Pathway

<!-- image -->

It is a robust system with adaptable algorithms which can be updated time-to-time. Additional, diseases or conditions under NP-NCD programme can be included on the platform. Details on the National NCD Portal architecture is placed as Annexure 8.

## Programme monitoring:

## Regular analysis of programme data reports:

At the national level, the monthly reports received from the States/UTs should be compiled and  analysed  to  generate  quarterly  national  reports  and  feedback  should  be  sent  to  the States regularly on a monthly basis. At the District NCD Divisions and State NCD Divisions, the monthly reports should be generated based only on the verified data received from health facilities. Periodically the reported data should be analysed at all levels, to understand the service  delivery  requirements  and  performance  assessment  of  NCD  Clinics.  The  program report generated from the National NCD Portal dashboard can be analysed at Centre, State and District for monitoring programme performance.

## Supervision:

Besides review meetings, frequent supervisory visits should be made by NCD officers and partners to various health facilities to oversee implementation of activities, as per operational guidelines. The standard supervisory checklists should be used to record observations and recommendations  for  action,  and  in  subsequent  visits,  the  action-taken-report  must  be reviewed.

<!-- image -->

## Programme review:

Review meetings of State NCD Programme Managers should be organized at the National level on a half-yearly basis, to assess physical and financial progress and discuss constraints in implementation of the programme. Similarly, every State should conduct review meetings on a quarterly basis to review programme implementation. Whereas at district and below level, it should be conducted monthly. Also, a small refresher training should be conducted during  review  meetings  by  using  pre-designed  job  aids.  External  programme  reviews  e.g. Common Review Mission (CRM) under NHM, or Joint Monitoring Missions (JMM), etc., may also be considered to get an insight into the programme implementation bottlenecks in the States/Districts. Sometimes, external evaluation of the programme may also be encouraged through studies/surveys by external agencies like research agencies, Medical Colleges, WHO, NGOs, etc

## Data quality assurance:

NP-NCD data as collected through National NCD Portal needs to be assessed for its quality to ensure its completeness and validation. Nearly 10% of the collected data must go through quality checks by program managers at each quarter or half yearly. State team can conduct regular monitoring visits to different districts and below for data quality checks to assess the effectiveness of NP-NCD which evaluate the service delivery, implementation of NP-NCD, and health outcomes in terms of defined indicators.

## Monitoring indicators:

In 2015, UN member states adapted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 defines to ensure health and promote well-being for all at all ages. For the achievement of SDG 3, SDG 3.4 targeted- by 2030, premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being reduced by one third. SDG Indicator 3.4.1 - Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease. Premature NCD mortality indicator as defined by the NCD Global Monitoring framework is unconditional probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases.

Mortality can be calculated based on the ICD codes: cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, Chronic respiratory: J30-J98. Numerator for this indicator can be deaths with International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code as the underlying cause of death among population during a calendar year and denominator can be midyear population for the same calendar year.

SDG Target 3.8 - Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

Indicator 3.8.1 - Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, NCDs and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population).

<!-- image -->

Tables depicting input, process and outcome indicators are placed as Annexure 9.1.

As  per  2nd  National  Conference  of  Chief  Secretaries  held  on  5 th -7 th January,  2023,  the action points emerged with respect to Non Communicable Diseases: Nutrition, Lifestyle and Management along with implementation timelines are placed at Annexure 9.2 .

## Surveillance:

Surveillance  is  defined  as  the  ongoing  systematic  collection,  analysis,  interpretation,  and timely dissemination of information for action linked to NP-NCD programme. Its key objectives are to trigger public health control measures, changes in chronic disease presentation and its risk factors, change in health practices and facilitate planning and implementation of the programme.

## FINANCES

NP-NCD  is  funded  under  the  common  NCD  flexi-pool  of  NHM.  The  States/UTs,  while formulating  their  interventions  for  NCDs,  incorporate  the  budget  for  the  same  within  the State NHM Programme Implementation Plan (PIP). The 'flexi-pool' allows States sufficient flexibility in providing funds to various components within the overall NCD allocation. The States are permitted to reassign funds among the various components to a certain extent after obtaining approval from the Government of India, but within the broad framework of NP-NCD.

Broad Activities permissible under NCD flexi-pool for NP-NCD are as follows:

- Health promotion and prevention
- Screening and case detection including Population-based screening
- Management of NCDs
- Human resources
- Capacity building
- Monitoring, evaluation, surveillance and research
- Integration with other programmes
- Public Private Partnership

Financial management groups (FMG) of Programme Management support units at state and district level, which are established under National Health Mission (NHM), are responsible for maintenance of accounts, release of funds, expenditure reports, utilization certificates and audit arrangements through the Finance and Logistics Consultant of the NCD Division.

## Project Implementation Plan (PIP):

The purpose of PIP is to make budgetary proposals for both regular as well as need-based activities for once in two years. The PIP planning process for NP-NCD follows a bottom-up approach. The process begins with 'District Health Action Plan (DHAP)' at the district level based on the inputs from all stakeholders including Block Medical Officer (BMO) in the districts. NP-NCD District PIP will be formed by DNO/DPO. All program unit plans are aggregated under DHAP. The District Program Management Unit (DPMU) will review DHAP and send it further to the District Health Society (DHS) which will finalise and submit it to the State.

The DHAPs of all Districts are reviewed, compiled, and aggregated under the State Program Management Unit (SPMU) with officials from the Mission Directorate and Directorate. The State PIP is submitted to the State Health Society (SHS) and finalised under the chairmanship of Principal Secretary. The final version of State PIPs is submitted to MoHFW, GoI.

<!-- image -->

The State PIP is appraised by the National Program Coordination Committee, which is chaired by Mission Director with officials from various program divisions in MoHFW and State officials. Once approved the States are issued with Record of Proceedings (RoP). Funds are provided in a phased manner to the State. The SHS implements the approved plan with governance and oversight exercised by the State Health Mission, in association with DHS. NP-NCD would operate through NCD Divisions constituted under the programme at State and District levels. The Statement of Expenditure (SOE) and Utilization Certificate (UC) as per GFR as amended from time to time should be submitted timely.

Under  the  PIP,  apart  from  the  budgetary  requirement,  if  States/UTs  request  funding  for innovative strategies/products, then on a case-to-case basis, this will be approved by the Ministry.  The results, if found satisfactory and scalable, it will be implemented at National level.

## Financial assistance:

The total funds to be released to each State under NP-NCD, are based on the number of units to be taken up at different levels on Centre Share: State Share basis. The funds are being provided to the States under NCD Flexi-Pool through State PIPs, with the Centre to State share in ratio of 60:40 (except for NE States and Hilly States, where the share is 90:10).

Details on financial assistance for NP-NCD programme is placed as Annexure 10.

## LINKAGES WITH OTHER PROGRAMMES

## Joint TB-diabetes collaborative activities:

People with a weak immune system after getting affected by diabetes are more prone to develop tuberculosis. Due to lack of early detection, it may go unnoticed and worsen the condition. On the other hand, TB is associated with poor glycaemic control. Both the instances lead to complications and high out of pocket expenditure. Therefore, to reduce TB-diabetes comorbidities,  collaborative  activities  will  be  planned  between  NP-NCD  and  NTEP.  Early detection of TB in NCD clinics and diagnosis of diabetes in TB clinics will be key activities. In CBAC format, one of the questions is related to TB-diabetes comorbidities to detect early by ASHA at community level. Joint monitoring mechanism was designed, and a standardized reporting system was shared.

NTEP and NP-NCD will conduct regular review meetings at national and state level. Chaired by MD NHM, a coordination committee is to be set at state level. Quarterly meetings should review activities and send feedback to the districts. Meeting minutes are to be shared with NCD division and CTD. District coordination committee also needs to be set, and quarterly meetings will be conducted from time to time. Meeting minutes will be shared with the state NCD Division and state TB Division. Operational research may also be planned.

## National Programme for Palliative care (NPPC):

Government of India launched NPPC in November, 2012 with a goal to ensure availability and accessibility of rational, quality pain relief and palliative care to the needy, as an integral part of Health Care at all levels, in alignment with the community requirements. The key objectives of  NPPC are to (i)  improve the capacity of service providers to provide palliative care, (ii) refine the legal and regulatory systems and support implementation and ensure access and availability of opioids while maintaining measures for preventing diversion and misuse, (iii) promote behaviour change in the community and (iv) ensure continuous progress towards the vision of the programme.

## Integration with National Urban Health Mission (NUHM):

The National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) was approved in 2013 as a sub-mission under the  overarching  National  Health  Mission  (NHM),  to  strengthen  delivery  of  primary  health care services in urban areas. NUHM aims to provide equitable access to quality health care to urban population with special focus on vulnerable populations in NCDs.

<!-- image -->

For integration with NP-NCD, a convergent plan has been developed between NUHM and NPNCD to promote comprehensive primary health care to reduce morbidity, mortality and DALY related to NCDs in urban areas. After NCD screening of the urban population, the suspected persons  will  be  referred  to  UPHC  for  registration,  laboratory  tests  and  management  of uncomplicated cases if a Medical Officer is available and resources permit, or else, they will be referred to the NCD Clinic in CHC/District Hospital. The NCD patients can, however, visit UPHCs for regular monthly drug-refills and investigations. The follow-up at community level will be done by ANM/ ASHA/ MAS. Besides health staff, all NP-NCD/NUHM State and district officials are also to be oriented on NP-NCD and NUHM and vice versa. At State/district level, it was suggested that NUHM and NP-NCD officials to conduct regular joint meetings preferably quarterly at state level and monthly at district level where planning, progress, gaps with respect to filling up of CBAC forms, NCD screening, reporting, trainings etc can be reviewed jointly.

## National Oral Health Programme (NOHP):

Government  of  India  launched  National  Oral  Health  Programme  to  provide  integrated, comprehensive oral  health  care  in  the  existing  health  care  facilities  with  the  objective  to improve the determinants of oral health, to reduce morbidity from oral diseases, to integrate oral  health  promotion  and  preventive  services  with  general  health  care  system,  and  to encourage Promotion of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) model for achieving better oral health.

## National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP):

Government  of  India  launched  the  National  Tobacco  Control  Programme  (NTCP)  in  the year  2007-08,  with  the  aim  to  (i)  create  awareness  about  the  harmful  effects  of  tobacco consumption, (ii) reduce the production and supply of tobacco products, (iii) ensure effective implementation  of  the  provisions  under  'The  Cigarettes  and  Other  Tobacco  Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003' (COTPA) (iv) help the people quit tobacco use, and (v) facilitate implementation  of  strategies  for  prevention  and  control  of  tobacco  advocated  by  WHO Framework  Convention  of  Tobacco  Control.  NTCP  is  implemented  through  a  three-tier structure, i.e. (i) National Tobacco Control Division (NTCC) at Central level (ii) State Tobacco Control  Division  (STCC)  at  State  level  and  (iii)  District  Tobacco  Control  Division  (DTCC)  at District level. There is also a provision of setting up Tobacco Cessation Services at the District level.

In  addition,  Tobacco  Cessation  Centres  (TCCs)  exist  almost  in  every  State/Union  Territory apart from the hospitals providing cessation facilities. One who wants to quit tobacco may visit these Centres and take pharmacological therapy (if required).

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has also started National Tobacco Quit Line to provide tobacco cessation counselling services to the community through a toll-free number (1800-11-2356) and has launched a pan-India, 'm-cessation' initiative to reach out to tobacco users who are willing to quit tobacco use and to support them towards successful quitting through text-messaging via mobile phones (on 011-22901701).

## National Programme for Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE):

NPHCE was launched in 2010 with an objective to provide dedicated health care facilities to the senior citizens (&gt;60 year of age). The programme aims to provide accessible, affordable, and  high-quality  long-term,  comprehensive  and  dedicated  care  services  to  an  Ageing population;  create  a  new  'architecture'  for  Ageing;  and  build  a  framework  to  create  an enabling environment for 'a Society for all Ages'. It also promotes the concept of Active and Healthy Ageing.

## National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB&amp;VI):

NPCB&amp;VI was launched in 1976 with the goal of reducing the prevalence of blindness to 0.3% by 2020. Main objectives of the programme are to reduce avoidable blindness; develop and strengthen the strategy of NPCB for 'Eye Health for All' and prevention of visual impairment; strengthening and up-gradation of Regional Institutes of Ophthalmology (RIOs) and partners like  Medical  College,  DH/  SDH,  Vision  Centres,  NGO  Eye  Hospitals;  strengthening  existing infrastructure  facilities  and  developing  additional  human  resources,  enhance  community awareness on preventive measures and expand research for prevention of blindness and visual impairment.

## Method of Screening of Diabetes by Strip method:

Things Needed:

1. A glucometer
2. Test strips
3. A lancet
4. A notebook and pen

Step 1: Take out the glucometer and place on a flat surface

Step 2: Remove a test strip from the container and place in the glucometer. One end will need to face the top of the glucometer; usually it has a darker colored line on it. This is where the blood will be placed for testing.

Step 3: Turn on your glucometer.

Step 4: Use a lancet to pierce the skin and obtain blood from the tip of a finger.

Step  5:  Place  the  blood  sample  on  the  test  strip.  The  test  strip  package  will  have  exact instructions, including blood sample size. Usually, this is accomplished by placing the blood drop against the edge or top of the strip.

Step 6: Watch the glucometer screen. It should show a 'waiting' or 'processing' symbol, and will emit a beep when the sample has been tested. The results will be displayed as a number on the screen.

Record your test results in your notebook and pass this information to MO.

## Criteria for diagnosing Diabetes:

## Diagnosis

| Diagnosis                  | Fasting Glucose (mg/dl)   | 2 hr Post Prandial Glucose (mg/dl)   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Diabetes Mellitus          | ≥126                      | ≥200                                 |
| Impaired Glucose Tolerance | <110                      | >140 to <200                         |
| Impaired Fasting Glucose   | ≥110 to <126              | <140                                 |

Criteria for suspected Diabetes case is reading of 140 mg/dl by glucostrip.

The suspected case needs to undergo further tests to confirm the diabetes.

## Steps for measuring Blood pressure using validate digital/automated BP apparatus:

- Ensure patient is relaxed and not talking.
- Back and arm supported and relaxed.
- Ensure  the  person  has  not  exercised,  had  tea/coffee,  or  used  tobacco  in  the  last  30 minutes.
- Person should rest comfortably and quietly for 5 minutes before the reading.
- Legs uncrossed and feet supported.
- Explain the procedure.
- Choose correct size cuff correct cuff size such that the bladder encircles 80%-100% of the upper arm.
- Deflate arm cuff before placing it around the arm.
- Cuff bladder width should be at least 40% of upper arm circumference.
- Ensure cuff is on bare arm or over thin layer of clothing. Avoid bunching of clothes under cuff.
- Cuff at the level of heart, tubing centered correctly.
- Turn monitor on.
- Press the START/STOP button.
- BP cuff will start to inflate and then slowly deflate.
- The systolic and diastolic readings and pulse rate will appear.
- Record exact reading, don't round off.
- Turn the machine off and remove the cuff.

## Diagnosis of Hypertension:

- Systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, on two different occasions. (Consider earlier BP measurement e.g. ANM screening).
- First BP is &lt;140/90 mmHg - no further measurement, use 1st BP.
- First BP is &gt;140/90 mmHg- take 2nd BP and use 2nd BP.
- Difference b/w 1st and 2nd BP is &gt;5mm Hg, take 3rd BP and use 3rd BP.

## When to take 2nd reading:

- SBP 140-159 or DBP 90-99: check on another day and if still elevated, start treatment.
- SBP 160-179 or DBP 100-109: second reading should be taken on the same day to confirm diagnosis. Start treatment on the same day.
- SBP 180 or DBP 110: refer to a specialist after starting treatment.
- If only systolic, or only diastolic is raised, manage according to higher numbers.

## India hypertension control initiative: good practices

1. Standardised  hypertension  treatment protocols  are  drug  and  dose-specific  established steps to take if BP is not controlled. Based on consensus from a state level expert committee each IHCI implementing state has adopted a State-specific hypertension treatment protocol consisting of three  drugs: Amlodipine, Telmisartan and Chlorthalidone (or Hydrochlorothiazide). It reduces unwarranted  clinical variability and therapeutic inertia and results in a more efficient and cost-effective selection  of medications and treatment approaches of medications and treatment approaches, facilitates  logistics, training, supervision, and evaluation. Similar standard treatment protocol developed for Diabetes management and implemented in several IHCI states.
2. Uninterrupted availability of hypertension and diabetes protocol medications at service delivery points through timely purchase of adequate quantities of drugs and equitable distribution to health  care facilities. Optimal forecasting and adequate budgeting are supported by the morbidity-based ' drug forecasting tool ' developed under IHCI.  A  few  practices  that  are  proving beneficial are: Floating  tenders at least 4 months in advance to expiry of existing rate contracts, provision for multi-year rate  contracts, empanelling multiple suppliers, purchase orders with scheduled supply, decentralisation of procurement to district and empowering health facilities for small volume local procurement.  Stock holding up to 3-months drug requirements at each health facility has been recommended and a  handy ' stock adequacy ready reckoner' has been made available at all levels for quick assessment  of stock position and supply chain decisions.
3. Information system with specific indicators have been established under IHCI to enable cohort-based  monitoring of enrolled patients on real-time basis. Reminder messages, overdue calling for patients  who have missed follow-up visit and facility to schedule next appointment to preferred facility where  key features of this information system along with QR coded BP passport and telemedicine.
4. Capacity building of Health care workers: Training, customized to meet the needs of different care providers depending on their roles and responsibilities, emphasizes on correct blood pressure measurement technique, communication skills, management skills, essentials of  drug  stock  management, drug quantification, and forecasting. The trained Cardiovascular health officers thereafter facilitate cascade-type training from State Nodal Officers at state level to healthcare staff at  all  levels  of  health  care  delivery.
5. Supportive supervision, monitoring, regular programmatic reviews and rapid course corrections  have been the cornerstone of the IHCI's continued progress and improvement. IHCI monthly reports  summarising the implementation progress, drug stock situation, findings from supervisory visits, key  achievements and challenges are shared with district and state nodal officers for necessary action.  The regular IHCI review meetings and supervisory visits provide an opportunity to learn the challenges  in implementation, assess the program performance and provide technical advice and guidance.

## Clinical decision support software enabled National NCD Portal: good practices

1. Evidence-based  diabetes  and  hypertension  care  delivery: treatment  algorithms in CDSS are based on the national guidelines, in accordance with the IPHS standards, and validated by domain experts. The CDSS-enabled National NCD Portal has features that supports all the three essential steps (screening, management, and follow-up) of chronic disease management. The CDSS platform considers many parameters to provide recommendations, such as clinical information, medical history, drug history, personal history, level of health facility, availability of drugs, and investigations. The CDSS system offers  a  cafeteria  choice  for  prescription  of  drugs  to  MOIC,  tailored  to  an  individual patient's clinical profile, which enables the MO to prescribe medicine according to their availability. Based on consensus from the state and district level advisory boards two drugs  from  a  class  of  prescribed  medicine  is  advocated  to  be  made  available  at  the facilities to ensure uninterrupted prescription.
2. Drug recommendations: As part of CDSS-enabled National NCD Portal functioning, it was ensured that at least two drugs per class of hypertension and diabetes medications based on the IPHS standards and the backend algorithms were available for ease of prescription by MOIC.
3. Multi-  stakeholder  engagement: Stakeholder discussions (healthcare providers, health administrators, bureaucrats and patients) were done to ensure that healthcare needs was addressed. Regular advocacy meetings with State and District level health authorities were done to ensure seamless supply of drugs and investigations at levels of health facilities.
4. Inherent  task  shifting  feature: To  enable  the  efficient  implementation  of  the  CDSS enabled CPHC NCD system, the fulcrum of care has been shifted from the physician to the nurse provider (referred to as task shifting). To enable task shifting the clinic workflow is  facilitated in a manner that it is the nurse who first interacts with the patient, adds information to the electronic case record form, following which the CDSS working at the backend generates guideline-based recommendations for the physician. Physicians thereby  receive  a  suitably  triaged  patient  with  a  draft  management  plan  based  on evidence- based guidelines, which ensures efficient utilisation of their time and enables objectivity in decision making. Since everything is digitised, the patient record can be seen at any level of the government health facility enabling seamless care, delivery of routine care, and facilitating clinically-mandated referral to an appropriate facility.
5. Trainings  and  refresher  trainings  of  physicians  and  non-physician  healthcare providers: Separate NP-NCD refresher trainings in addition to the CDSS training were conducted to facilitate adoption by different cadre of healthcare providers. The trainings were discussion based and included role plays to acquaint the participants about the community  scenarios  they  might  encounter  and  the  strategies  they  should  adopt  to advocate lifestyle modifications.
6. Monitoringand Evaluationactivities : Regularactivitieslikesupportivesupervision, handholding, and continuous monitoring were carried out to identify and address any processes required to improve efficiency of the system. Process indicators were regularly monitored to ensure smooth implementation. Annual/bi-annual review meetings with international,  national,  state  and  district  advisory  boards  were  useful  in  providing insights on the corrective course of actions needed for implementation and scale up.

## National NCD Portal - Architecture considerations

## 1. Plug and Play Model to Allow Configurability

A  federated  enterprise  architecture  allows  a  vast  network  of  loosely  coupled,  semiautonomous entities to exchange information in a standardized secure manner. It fosters innovation by allowing easy development of apps on the platform and allows for modular expansion by its adherence to standards. A variety of patient apps can be developed that allow the individual to have a comprehensive view of her health record and track her visits, her wellness metrics and care regimen. In National NCD Portal, a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for hypertension and diabetes has been plugged into the platform through standardized interfaces for use in one state/district while other states continue to use existing Government protocols.

## 2. Open-Source stack

An  open-source  platform  leads  to  stronger  community  participation  for  ecosystem innovations and sustainability. National NCD Portal is completely built on open-source stack

## 3. Opensource Platform

The National NCD Portal source code is completely open sourced and hosted in www. openforge.gov.in.  State  governments  are  encouraged  to  contribute  the  opensource platform and strengthen it.

## 4. Authenticated, Secure Data Exchange with Privacy by Design

According to the National Resource Center for EHR standards (NRCeS), the government (as a health provider) is only a custodian of health data while ownership lies with the individual.  National  NCD  Portal  has  a  4-pronged  security  strategy  below  as  shown  in figure below.

<!-- image -->

## 5. Encryption and Secure Data Exchange

<!-- image -->

The architecture of a large-scale health system must have robust security features designed into the system. Digital keys used in cryptographic functions must be safeguarded and periodically  rotated.    In  National  NCD  Portal,  data  is  securely  encrypted  whether  it  is at rest or in transit within the system, using the best available encryption key strength. Secure transmission standards like HTTPS, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 are adopted, along with digital signatures for ensuring authenticity of identity.

## 6. Authentication and Authorization

As  digital  ecosystems  mature,  it  is  imperative  that  access  to  data  is  role-based  in concordance with institutional policy and pertinent laws. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, it is still not a common practice or expectation that identities be masked from health  datasets.  To  enable  role-based  access,  National  NCD  Portal  authenticates  user credentials through identity management and authentication services. Security features like strong password management, automatic logging off, captcha, access privileges, and interface data validations are part of the platform.

## 7. Audit Trail

To  ensure  accountability  and  transparency,  all  transactions  should  have  a  clear  audit trail  that  records  user  identity,  identifies  the  datasets  accessed,  with  timestamps  and transaction description. Audit trails should be available to authenticated users on demand or on a periodic basis for compliance monitoring as mandated by policy.

## 8. Integration with National health systems

Health  systems  digitization  journey  has  accelerated,  and  single-source-of-truth  data should be made available to external system as and when required. National NCD Portal is  integrated  with  HWC IT System for data reporting, Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) for creating and linking Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) and consented data sharing with other health systems. The system should have Health ID printing and QR Code scanning. The health data should be linked only after AADHAAR based consent as recommended MoHFW.

## 9. National-NCD Portal API Specification

National  NCD  Portal  built  with  modular  architecture  and  open  standards.  The  API Specification  for  below  modules  are  standardized  and  available  for  consumption  by interested parties. For more details, please contact NCD division in MoHFW.
