## 1. INTRODUCTION

The clinical trial program of a medicinal product under development rarely includes pregnant women, (unless the product is intended specifically for use during pregnancy), however, some pharmacological treatments  cannot  be  discontinued  during  pregnancy.  In  most  clinical  trials  in  which  women  of childbearing  age  are  included,  effective  contraception  must  be  used.  For  this  reason,  the  only  data available  to  evaluate  reproductive  risk  when  a  new  medicinal  product  is  approved  for  marketing  is virtually  from  non-clinical  studies,  and  although  these  non-clinical  studies  can  be  useful  to  predict human risk, the extent of prediction needs to be taken with caution.

Consequently,  many  medicinal  products  are  subject  to  contraindications  or  special  warnings  because they have not been sufficiently studied during pregnancy or studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the foetus (teratogenic, foetotoxic or other).

Once a product is marketed, the major objective of pharmacovigilance with regard to the exposure of pregnant  women  is  to  collect  information  on  safety  in  pregnancy  so  that  better  information  can  be provided  to  health  care  practitioners  and  patients.  Information  on  drug  exposure  in  pregnancy  is necessary to identify agents harmful to the developing foetus. Conversely, data on pregnancy exposure can also establish that the foetal toxicity of a product is limited.

Use of medicines in pregnancy is not uncommon and different studies have shown that there is a high variability  in  the  frequency  of  drug  use  during  pregnancy  among  different  countries.  It  is  also recognised that many pregnancies are unplanned, and some prescription and non-prescription medicinal products are frequently used by women of childbearing age, despite the fact that the benefits and risks are often unknown or poorly characterised.

## 1.1 Scope of the guideline

This guideline aims at providing criteria to select medicinal products for which active surveillance for collecting  post-authorisation  data  in  pregnancy  is  necessary.  It  provides  guidance  on  how  to  monitor accidental or intended exposure to medicinal products during pregnancy and specific requirements for reporting  data  and  adverse  outcomes  of  pregnancy  exposure.  The  guideline  also  includes  detailed recommendations regarding presentation of data collected on exposure in pregnant women.

The  guideline  relates  in  particular  to  new  products,  for  which  a  summary  of  the  potential  risks  of exposure in pregnancy and of the potential need for the product during pregnancy should be included in the  Pharmacovigilance  Specification  provided  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  at  the time of the MA  application. The aim of these specifications is that the  MAH  proposes  a Pharmacovigilance Plan in order to evaluate the potential risk of a product and/or to provide missing information on the safety of the product in pregnancy.

It is recommended that a similar pharmacovigilance plan is developed for established products, when a new  major  safety  concern  has  arisen,  and  for  'old  products',  for  which  reliable  data  in  animals  are lacking and experience in humans is poorly documented.

The guideline also concerns the use of medicinal products in men, as products might have effects on the foetus via semen due to their mutagenic or teratogenic potential.

## 1.2 Aspects not covered in the guideline

It should be noted that this guideline will not cover specific aspects of safety and efficacy of medicinal products authorised for pregnancy-related symptoms and disorders or pro-fertility drugs. Other products like herbal medicines and the use of medicinal products during breast-feeding are not covered either in this guideline.

## 2. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE NEED TO COLLECT INFORMATION

## 2.1 Background

The majority of medicinal products or chemical substances administered to a pregnant woman could have effects on the foetus either before the placenta is fully developed or subsequently, if they can cross the placenta to at least some extent. Substances used for therapeutic purposes in the mother have the potential to reach the foetus with the consequential potential for harmful effects, depending on whether the rate and extent of drug transfer results in sufficient concentrations within the foetus.

Medicinal  products  may  have  a  different  impact  at  different  stages  of  pregnancy.  The  spectrum  of effects  varies  according  to  the  period  of  exposure.  For  example,  the  exposure  to  a  teratogenic  agent during the period of organogenesis may induce major malformation, growth retardation or death, while exposure  during  the  second  or  third  trimester  may  induce  growth  retardation,  renal  insufficiency, neurological disorders, stillbirth, etc. On the other hand, exposure to a teratogenic agent during the first two  weeks  of  pregnancy  (3rd  and  4th  gestational  week)  may  lead  either  to  the  death  or  to  a  normal preembryo  according  to  the  "all  or  nothing  rule";  at  this  period  zygotes  and  blastocysts  contain omnipotent stem cells without any differentiation, therefore, teratogenic agents may lead to seriously damaged  preembryos,  which  will  not  survive,  or  to  less  seriously  damaged  preembryos,  which  will survive with complete regeneration.

Drug treatment of male patients prior to or around the time of conception and/or during pregnancy could affect  the  offspring  due  to  a  drug-induced  defect  in  the  spermatozoon  itself  such  as  an  effect  on  the DNA or chromosome or due to an effect caused by the presence of the drug in the seminal fluid.

Two important conclusions can be drawn from the above considerations:

In order to minimise the foetal risk of exposure, drug therapy of the mother should be restricted as much as  possible.  This  principle,  however,  cannot  be  applied  in  all  cases.  The  mother  may  have  a  serious illness which requires treatment, or a condition that untreated may pose significant risk to the foetus.

In order to optimise the knowledge about any potential teratogenic or embryotoxic/foetotoxic effects of a medicinal product and the doses and concentrations at which such effects will develop, it is desirable to gather information about all medicinal products taken by pregnant women.

## 2.2 Assessing the need for information on drug exposure

It  is  good  practice  to  always  try  to  collect  information  on  medicinal  exposure  during  pregnancy. However, there are various situations in which an assessment of the foetal effects following exposure of pregnant women to medicinal products is particularly important:

- Conditions and diseases where drug therapy is essential for maternal and/or foetal benefit and where discontinuation or omission of treatment would result in increased risk for the mother and/or the foetus.

In these situations, the potential harm posed by drug therapy to the foetus must be weighed against  the  risk  of  lack  of  therapy  both  to  the  mother  and  the  foetus.  Examples  of  such conditions  and  diseases  include  asthma,  autoimmune  disorders,  diabetes  mellitus,  epilepsy, high  blood  pressure,  thyroid  disorders,  infections,  intoxications,  malignant  diseases,  severe psychiatric  disorders,  thromboembolic  events,  as  well  as  use  of  general  anaesthetics  and treatments for prevention of transplant rejection.

There  is  a  special  need  for  information  in  situations  when  available  treatment  options  are already  limited  due  to  known  or  suspected  risks  established  from  animal  studies  or  human experience.  Examples  of  these  situations  include:  antiepileptic,  antineoplastic,  antithyroid agents, antiretrovirals. This must not, however, be equated with a waiver for other products, for  which  only  limited  or  no  information  about  their  impact  during  pregnancy  exists.  The database established for collecting information on antiretroviral therapy is a good example of a

solution  to  the  problems  of  collecting  information,  which  could  be  followed  for  other products.

- Conditions  and  symptoms  where  drug  treatment,  although  not  necessarily  required,  is frequently  given,  with  or  without  prescription.  This  group  mainly  comprises  treatment  of common  symptoms  such  as  constipation,  fatigue,  mild  to  moderate  forms  of  allergic symptoms, common cold, fever, mood alterations, nausea/vomiting and pain.

Safety concerns emphasise the need for data collection on exposure during pregnancy and the importance  of  pregnancy  databases  in  revealing  potential  teratogenic/embryo-foetotoxic signals.  On  the  other  hand,  medicinal  products  for  which  well-conducted  epidemiological studies in pregnant women failed to demonstrate a risk to the foetus may be exempted.

- Treatment with drugs belonging to a class of substances having a similar chemical structure or mechanism of action to:
- -Substances of which the teratogenic, embryotoxic, foetotoxic or mutagenic effects in humans is suspected from case reports and animal studies;
- -Substances  of  which  the  potential  for  teratogenic  or  embryotoxic/foetotoxic  or  mutagenic effects in humans has already been established;

In  these  cases,  it  is  of  special  importance  to  monitor  any  exposure  to  the  substance  in  case pregnancy is diagnosed or appropriate contraceptive measures were either not taken or failed.

- Drugs  either  representing  a  completely  new  chemical  entity  or  exhibiting  a  new  mode  of action (e.g. biotechnology products), if not already covered by the previous categories.

## 2.3 Specific recommendations for surveillance

The  medicinal  products  for  which  there  is  a  special  need  for  surveillance  during  pregnancy  are identified according to the above-mentioned criteria. For these medications, the MAH should develop appropriate  measures  of  active  surveillance  as  laid  down  in  a  risk  minimisation  plan.  The  choice  of method of surveillance will depend on how frequently the medicinal product is used, the type of adverse outcome to be monitored (e.g. birth defects, malignancy, psychomotor retardation) and the magnitude of the risk.

A commitment from the MAH to introduce such pro-active monitoring is expected especially for those products referred to under the first and third bullet points above.

In  general,  exposure  during  the  whole  pregnancy  should  be  monitored.  For  medicinal  products  with long  half-lives,  data  on  exposure  before  the  start  of  pregnancy  should  also  be  provided,  with  an appropriate time frame to be chosen according to the pharmacokinetics of the individual drugs.

In  accordance  with  ICH  E2E  on  Pharmacovigilance  Plans  and  the  CHMP  Risk  Management  System Guideline, the MAH should describe in the safety specifications a summary of the identified risks of a drug,  potential  risks,  and  missing  information  for  pregnancy.  The  MAH  should  take  into  account information  such  as  possible  teratogenicity  or  foetotoxicity  observed  in  preclinical  studies,  or  class effects (like neonatal reactions observed in a given drug class, e.g. withdrawal syndrome)

In  all  cases,  the  MAH  should  state  which  specific  actions  will  be  taken  for  risk  management  and  on what basis these actions will be reported upon.

## 3. REVIEW OF POTENTIAL SOURCES OF HUMAN PREGNANCY DATA

This  section  provides  a  list  of  the  key  methods  which  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the  potential  risk  of exposure to a specific medicinal product during pregnancy (or to provide missing information). The list is not all-inclusive.

## 3.1 Human Pregnancy Data from Pre-Authorisation studies

In clinical trials which include female patients of reproductive age, there may be occasional inadvertent pregnancy exposure to the medicinal product. This inadvertent exposure is usually restricted to the early first trimester. Efforts should be made to collect data on the drug effects as well as the outcome for both mother and foetus.

For individuals who must have a medicine during pregnancy for treatment of an underlying disease and have been fully informed of the known benefits and risks, opportunities for collecting pharmacokinetic information,  comparing  blood  levels  in  pregnant  women  in  different  trimesters  and  in  non-pregnant women receiving the same dose should be considered. Again there should be assiduous collection of data on the outcome for both mother and child.

Data  from  physiological  studies,  for  example  of  hepatic  and  renal  blood  flow  or  CYP3A4  activity during  pregnancy,  may  also  predict  changes  in  activation  or  clearance  of  specified  products  during pregnancy.

## 3.2 Human Pregnancy Data collected Post-Authorisation

## 3.2.1 Sources of data information

## 3.2.1.1 Spontaneous reports / Case series

Spontaneous  reports  of  pregnancy  exposure  are  the  most  common  source  of  post-authorisation  data available on the safety of medicinal products in pregnancy.

Sources include databases of regulatory authorities, national congenital anomaly registries, MAHs and the National Association of Medical Examiner's Pediatric Toxicology (PedTox registry (US).

Data are often limited to spontaneous reports of adverse outcomes. Even if the nature of spontaneous reports from pregnancies rarely permits determination of a causal link between a single product and an outcome, the occurrence of several reports of a distinct congenital abnormality associated with exposure may constitute a signal and a number of teratogens have been identified in this way. Existing systems for  spontaneous  reports  of  toxicity  should,  however,  be  optimised.  Specific  recommendations  and requirements for reporting data and adverse outcomes of pregnancy exposure are provided in section 4 of this guideline.

It  is  also  important  to  collect  information  on  pregnancies  which  have  a  normal  outcome.  Not infrequently, pregnant women or health care professionals will contact MAHs or local pharmacovigilance centres to request information on the teratogenic potential of a drug which has been taken either before the woman realised she was pregnant or without realising the possible effects on the foetus.  This  is  an  ideal  opportunity  to  collect  data  on  the  exposure.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to contact the health care professional, who is caring for the woman, for the outcome of the pregnancy.

## 3.2.1.2   Record linkage

For long-term 'structural' effects and some 'non-structural' - (and therefore not immediately detectable) problems, registry data could be a source of information, provided that a registry containing exposure data could be linked with subsequent information collected later in life on the exposed individuals. If information is available from computerised medical files on a defined exposed group of individuals with unique  identification  numbers,  the  files  can  be  cross-linked  to  other  files,  containing  information  on subsequent progress of those individuals.

Record linkage has been used to assess effects of parental alcohol and/or smoking habits or occupation on  certain  neonatal  outcomes.  In  another  example,  a  lack  of  association  between  intra-muscular administration of vitamin K to newborn infants and subsequent childhood cancer (an association that had  been  postulated  in  a  previous  smaller  study)  was  demonstrated  with  high  statistical  power  by linking the Swedish Medical Birth Registry to a cancer registry.

## 3.2.1.3 Registries

## 3.2.1.3.1 Birth defect registries

A population-based registry of children born with congenital malformations is one of the available tools for  the  investigations  of  birth  defects,  and  has  been  used  for  conducting  case-control  studies  (see 3.2.3.6).

## 3.2.1.3.2 Pregnancy registries

Prospective pregnancy registries for screening and analysis have been used to identify and estimate risks associated with exposure to medicinal products. Registries may also be used to identify risk modifiers and to quantify longer-term effects. Possible sources for European registry studies include the Swedish Medical  Birth  Registry,  a  national  population  based  registry,  accumulating  data  on  drug  exposure during pregnancy for the whole pregnant population of Sweden (&gt;90,000 per annum).

Registries  may  focus  on  different  aspects,  depending  on  whether  they  are  set  up  and  coordinated centrally by government agencies, such as the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, by industry or academia. Thus, a registry can be organised to monitor a specific medicinal product, to follow patients suffering from a specific medical condition or have a wider focus on a whole population. The accuracy of the registry information will be highly dependent on the access to case records of mother and neonate, i.e. both exposure and outcome data must be available.

Those set up by industry to monitor specific medicinal products such as the AntiRetroviral Pregnancy Registry  are  named  'pregnancy  registry'  but  do  not  correspond  to  a  'registry'  from  a  pharmacoepidemiological viewpoint since they don't register all cases of pregnancy exposure to the concerned medicinal product. Indeed they are based on voluntary reporting.

## 3.2.2 Clinical studies

## 3.2.2.1 Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)

Where the  study  is  in  the  best  interest  of  both  mother  and  infant,  an  RCT  may  be  feasible.  Despite barriers,  particularly  the  ethical  considerations,  conducting  RCTs  in  pregnant  women,  there  are occasional reports of such studies in the literature (e.g. asthma, HIV). Studies may also aim to prove a beneficial effect of a medicinal product on the foetus (e.g. studies on the use of folic acid in women around the time of conception to investigate potential preventive effects on the development of neural tube defects).

## 3.2.2.2 Comparative observational studies

## 3.2.2.2.1 Cohort studies

There are several publications from cohort studies investigating the effects of drugs in pregnant women. The advantage with cohort studies is that identification of patients before the outcome is known will eliminate recall bias. Cohort studies need to be adequately controlled for underlying medical conditions, disease severity, multiple medications and demographic factors. Despite the fact that these conditions may be difficult to fulfil, cohort studies may be interpretable and useful.

## 3.2.2.2.2 Case control studies

These studies identify individuals with a specific outcome (e.g. a congenital malformation), against a control group and assess both groups with regards to exposure. In the case of specific malformations, these studies often have sufficient statistical power, but they might be subject to recall bias if data are collected retrospectively.

The  Hungarian  case  control  surveillance  of  congenital  abnormalities,  which  also  includes  some prospectively collected data, includes data on more than 22,000 cases, 38,000 population controls and more than 800 patient controls with a specific genetic abnormality (Down Syndrome). It is the largest case control data set in the world and has been used for the analysis of more than 500 drugs.

## 3.2.2.3 Study areas of specific interest

## 3.2.2.3.1 Foetal therapy studies

Efficacy and safety information from studies with predefined outcomes (e.g. use of corticosteroids in mothers  with  preterm  labour  to  induce  foetal  pulmonary  maturation),  should  be  collected.  Outcome measures include foetal  loss  and  infant  mortality  rates,  gestational  age  at  delivery  (as  determined  by LMP  and/or  ultrasound),  birth  weight,  premature  rupture  of  membranes,  neonatal  complications, congenital malformations and developmental delay.

## 3.2.2.3.2 Pharmacokinetic studies

A number of studies in the literature have addressed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of specific medicines in pregnancy (notably antibiotics,  valaciclovir,  theophylline,  methadone,  antiepileptics,  nortriptyline and enoxaparin). Studies have particularly addressed the PK of agents for which a benefit from therapy is known,  particularly  addressing  the  late  second  and  third  trimesters  and  early  post-partum  period. Population PK studies have been suggested as a preliminary step prior to conducting more invasive and intensive PK studies (or possibly as their replacement).

## 3.2.2.3.3 Pharmacogenetic studies

It  has  been  suggested  that  high  maternal  concentrations  of  both  the  active  compound  and  poor elimination of toxic metabolites may be major determinants of malformations. Data on gene expression in pregnancy and metabolic variation may, in specific instances, help to predict effects and to identify individuals at a higher risk.

## 3.2.3 Other Potential sources of information

Some sources providing information on congenital birth defects are listed below:

- Organisation of Teratogen Information Services (OTIS) (http://www.teratology.org)
- European network of Teratogen Information Services (ENTIS) (http://www.entis-org.com)
- EUROCAT (http://www.eurocat.ulster.ac.uk)
- International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring Systems (http://www.icbd.org)
- European collaboration of craniofacial anomalies (http://www.eurocran.org)

Apart  from  these  sources,  information  may  be  available  elsewhere,  for  example  through  regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, national antenatal records, patient societies, professional societies, (e.g. obstetricians, neonatologists, teratologists, geneticists, pathologists, pharmacists, primary care, nurses/midwives).

## 3.3 Quality of collected data

## 3.3.1 Exposure data

All studies, including those based on registries, should try to address exposure in specified time periods of  the  pregnancy.  Information  on  timing,  dose  and  duration  should  be  recorded  as  accurately  as possible.  High  levels  of  recruitment  have  been  achieved  using  direct  prospective  enrolment,  either specifically for pregnancy exposure studies, or in addition to routine contact with a healthcare provider such as at prenatal care visits.

Ideally, medicinal products should be studied individually as all members of a given drug class do not necessarily have the same potential for adverse effects on pregnancy and/or the foetal development.

## 3.3.2 Outcome data

Adverse  outcome  data  of  foetal  exposure  comprise  both  structural  malformations,  ('typical'  birth defects,  often  -  but  not  always  -  detected  in  the  neonatal  period)  and  non-structural  or  long-term functional  effects  (not  easily  detected  in  the  immediate  neonatal  period)  that  can  be  potentially important but also difficult to detect or define.

Some cardiac, renal and intestinal malformations are not always diagnosed immediately postpartum, and incidence  is  significantly  influenced  by  duration  of  follow-up  and  availability  of  diagnostic  tests. Therefore, long-term follow-up is recommended when possible and appropriate.

It is important to note that the incidence of a given malformation may be influenced by the degree of use of  antenatal  diagnosis  and  subsequent  abortion.  This  is  particularly  important  with  the  most  severe malformations, for example anencephaly. Such outcome data may be difficult to retrieve, but should be sought.

To detect an increase in abnormalities incompatible with life, it is important to collect information on autopsy results at stillbirth and, if possible, on examinations of the foetus after spontaneous or induced abortion.

Additionally, reviewing birth certificates is not an accurate method of ascertaining pregnancy outcome as  individuals  who  have  not examined the neonate often complete the forms, while neonatal hospital records  are  more  reliable.  However,  diagnoses  may  arise  or  can  be  modified  as  the  child  is  more thoroughly examined and undergoes additional testing. Involvement of mothers could minimise lack of follow-up. Registries involving examination by a group of professionals (ideally including a paediatrician)  following  a  specific  protocol  and  allowing  for  blinding  to  maternal  exposure  could generate more informative data also from a smaller number of patients, e.g. an epilepsy registry.

It  is  important  to  collect  details  of  'normal'  outcomes  to  provide  not  only  reassurance  but  also information on possible exposure times when other outcomes have been abnormal.

## 3.3.3 Data standardisation

The validity of information is dependent on the accuracy of diagnosis and recording. Exposure dates are important, as susceptible periods for specific malformations may be less than one week.

The  critical  developmental  stages  for  individual  human  organs  should  be  used  to  optimise  data collection and interpretation.

Most reports  and  studies  focus  on  lethal  or  serious/major  malformations  using  standard  international medical terminology (most often WHO ICD10). Minor malformations, especially if several occur in a neonate, may  point  to the risk  of  major  malformations  and,  therefore,  information  on  minor malformations should not be dismissed..

Universal  pregnancy-specific  normal  ranges  of  laboratory  values  should  be  also  used  to  enable judgements to be made quickly and accurately.

## 4. REPORTING DATA AND ADVERSE OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCY EXPOSURE

## 4.1 Scope

As for all Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reporting, the MAH is responsible for reporting data on and adverse outcomes after pregnancy exposure with all medicinal products, regardless of the procedure of authorisation (i.e. centralized, national and mutual recognition procedures).

Cases  reported  spontaneously  by  health-care  professionals,  cases  originating  from  pre-  or  postauthorisation studies and those originating from the worldwide literature should be included.

## 4.2 Content of a report

## 4.2.1 General recommendations

It is essential that MAHs collects and provide as many elements as possible for all cases to facilitate the evaluation.

The minimum required data elements for the reports of adverse outcomes (e.g. congenital abnormality etc) and data on pregnancy exposure with or without ADR are similar to those required for any ADR report, i.e. an identifiable patient, an identifiable reporter, a suspected ADR and a suspected medicinal product.

All the specific data elements necessary for the assessment of cases of pregnancy exposure should be included in the narrative, such as:

- The type of report: retrospective or prospective

Prospective  data  of  pregnancy  exposure  are  data  acquired  prior  to  the  knowledge  of  the pregnancy  outcome  or  prior  to  the  detection  of  a  congenital  malformation  at  prenatal examination (e.g. foetal ultrasound, serum markers).

Retrospective  data  of  pregnancy  exposure  are  data  acquired  after  the  outcome  of  the pregnancy is known or after the detection of a congenital malformation on prenatal test.

- Information  on  exposure  to  medicinal  products  during  pregnancy  should  include  dates  of exposure  as  accurately  as  possible.  Gestational  length,  should  be  specified  by  method  of assessment and expressed as weeks + days, preferably calculated from early foetal ultrasound. This information is necessary to establish the causal relationship between the adverse events reported and the period of exposure to a product.
- Exposure  to  other  teratogens  (e.g.  infections,  maternal  disease,  environmental  factors,  coadministered medicinal product), familial history of congenital anomaly etc.
- The results of examinations performed: foetal ultrasound, amniocentesis, laboratory tests, etc.

In order to obtain standardised and detailed information from the reporter, MAHs are recommended to set up and use a structured questionnaire. A list of data elements to be considered when establishing a questionnaire is provided in annex 1.

In certain circumstances, MAHs can be requested to submit the structured questionnaire to regulatory agencies (e.g. for products with a highly teratogenic potential).

## 4.2.2 Special situations:

Special efforts should be made by the MAH in the following situations:

- For cases of congenital malformations, to get this medically confirmed and to provide a full description of the congenital malformation. Whenever possible all investigations done in the paediatric ward and the medical records should be provided.
- For  cases  of  spontaneous  abortion,  to  specify  the  time  of  occurrence  and  history  of spontaneous abortion.
- For  cases  of  termination  of  pregnancy  after  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy,  to  obtain  and provide the results of foetal autopsy and prenatal tests (e.g. ultrasound, amniocentesis, serum markers).

- For cases of late foetal death, to collect results of prenatal tests (e.g. ultrasound, amniocentesis, serum markers), results of the autopsy (if available) and other factors that may have had an impact on foetal loss (e.g. concomitant disease).
- For  cases  of  paternal  exposure,  to  collect  information  on  the  father  (e.g.  date  of  exposure, occupation,  environmental  factors,  medical  history  and  drugs  co-administered)  and  on  the mother  (e.g. concomitant  diseases, possible date of conception, course of  pregnancy, treatments).
- Where medicinal products are known (or suspected) to induce teratogenic or foetotoxic effects and are therefore contra-indicated (or not recommended) in pregnant women, the circumstances relating to the pregnancy should be documented (e.g. patient 'not aware' of the risk,  contraception  failure)  and  MAH  should  provide  information  on  the  outcome  of  the pregnancy.

## 4.2.3 Follow-up data

At the time of their first contact with the MAH, health care professionals should systematically be made aware of the usefulness of providing data on both the exposure and the outcome of pregnancy.

Cases  from  health-care  professionals  should  be  monitored  until  the  pregnancy  outcome.  Attempts should be made by the MAH to follow up cases from patients through health care providers in all cases. In  order  to  obtain  follow-up  information,  the  MAH  is  recommended  to  set  up  and  use  a  specified procedure. This can consist on a telephone interview or mailing a questionnaire to the obstetrician/physician involved with the care of the patient after the expected date of delivery.

The scope of a report of exposure in pregnancy does not end at birth. In case of congenital anomalies, the MAH should try to provide an assessment of the severity of the malformation (surgery planned) and the final diagnosis, if available (e.g. the conclusions of a genetic counselling).

## 4.3 Expedited reporting requirements

As for ADR reporting in general, expedited reports should be reported immediately, and in no case later than  15  calendar  days  from  receipt  (see  Vol.  9  of  the  Rules  Governing  Medicinal  Products  in  the European Union).

This includes

- Reports of congenital anomaly(ies) in foetus, child
- Reports of late foetal death
- Reports of spontaneous abortion
- Reports of ADRs in a newborn/neonate that is fatal, life-threatening, resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or resulting in or prolonging hospitalisation.

Other cases, i.e. reports of termination of pregnancy without information on congenital malformation and  reports  of  pregnancy  exposure  without  outcome  data  should  not  normally  be  reported  on  an expedited basis. These and reports of normal outcomes of pregnancy should be reported in PSURs.

In  certain  circumstances,  MAHs  can  be  requested  to  treat  any  reports  of  pregnancy  exposure  as expedited  cases,  e.g.  pregnancy  exposure  to  products  contra-indicated  in  pregnancy  due  to  a  high teratogenic potential (e.g. thalidomide, isotretinoin).

In  accordance  with  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended and  Regulation  (EC)  No 726/2004, the MAH should use the same method to submit this data as used for ADR reporting, therefore save in exceptional circumstances, these reports should be transmitted electronically using the ICH E2B(M) format through the EudraVigilance system.

The  ICH  E2B(M)  format  includes  a  specific  section  for  parent-child/foetus  reports  that  contains information on the parent and this section should be completed in accordance with the ICH E2B(M) specifications. The route of administration of the drug for the child would normally be transplacental, in cases where the father has taken the drug the route of administration should be marked as unknown. The route of administration of how the parent took the drug should be captured in the field ICH E2B(M) "parent's  route  of  administration".  Specific  recommendations  for  the  transmission  of  Individual  Case Safety Reports (ICSR) of pregnancy exposure are provided in annex 2. Since the E2B(M) fields do not capture all the elements listed in Annex 2, In all cases a case narrative capturing these data elements should systematically provided with the case report.

Specific recommendations for the transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) of pregnancy exposure are provided in annex 2.

In all cases, the MedDRA terminology which has very extensive obstetrical and neonatal terms must be used for the medical terms.

The  follow-up  information  of  serious  cases  should  be  transmitted  to  regulatory  authorities  on  an expedited basis.

## 5. REPORTING PREGNANCY EXPOSURE IN PSURS

## 5.1 Requirements

As stated in both the ICH E2C guideline as well in the Notice to Marketing Authorisation Holders, part of Volume 9 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union, positive or negative experiences during pregnancy should be reported. These data will be reported in a section of chapter 9 of the PSUR. In addition, bibliographical data, cumulative figures together with a summary table (see annex 3) should also be provided.

In case there is an issue regarding for instance teratogenicity , foetotoxicity , neonatal adverse reactions stated in the Pharmacovigilance Plan and/or Risk Management Plan for a certain active substance the MAH will provide an update on these issues in every PSUR to be submitted.

## 5.2 Post-Authorisation Data

Sources of pregnancy outcome  data reported during post-authorisation (see section 3.2 PostAuthorisation Human Pregnancy Data) can be case reports, epidemiology studies, data from pregnancy registries etc.

Pregnancy outcomes may be:

- Live birth, normal,
- Live birth, abnormal:

Pre-term, term, post-term birth

Small for gestational age infants/ Intrauterine growth retardation

Drug withdrawal syndrome in the neonate

Malformations

Morbidity

- Foetal death:

Ectopic

Miscarriage

Stillbirth

- Termination of pregnancy

In cases of induced or spontaneous abortions and intra-uterine death, it should be mentioned whether the embryo/foetus had apparent congenital malformation.

## 5.2.1 Case reports

Case reports should be analysed separately from studies and registries. Case reports can be spontaneous reports  by  healthcare  professionals,  published  case  reports,  or  case  reports  from  studies  and  reports received from  regulatory  authorities. Cases  from  patients  are to be validated by  a healthcare professional. If not, these cases must  be analysed and presented separately from  the others. Recommendations for the content of a case report have been provided above in section 4.3.

The  MAH  should  present  the  outcome  of  these  case  reports  in  a  summary  table  and  categorise  the malformations according to the MedDRA SOC ( Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, System Organ Class. From 1 January 2003 the MAHs must report Adverse Events in MedDRA terms ).  The prevalence of the cases should be defined and analysed taking into account the background prevalence of pregnancy outcome in the general childbearing population.

Data collected prospectively should be separated from data collected retrospectively. Different ways for calculating the prevalence are given in the glossary (see annex 4).

In PSURs of products which have suspected teratogenic/mutagenic potential, or new chemical entities, the MAH should enclose the individual case reports received during the reporting period of a PSUR, and also analyse and provide cumulative pregnancy data.

## 5.2.2 Epidemiology studies

Epidemiological studies, as described in the pharmacovigilance specifications, and their results, should be  discussed  in  detail  in  chapter  7  ("Studies")  of  the  PSUR  with  reference  to  the  specific  section  in chapter 9, and summarised in chapter 9.

Results  of  epidemiological  studies  should  be  analysed  as  defined  in  the  study  protocol.  Pregnancy outcome  of  congenital  malformation,  possibly  suggestive  of  a  treatment  related  effect,  should  be investigated for a possible trend and outcomes must be summarised in chapter 9.

## 5.2.3 Pregnancy registries

Data from registries (internal or external) should be analysed on a regular basis and the analyses should be discussed in the PSUR. The data in those registries are in the majority of cases prospective; therefore the outcome results will contain also pregnancies with healthy infants born at term. Usually an analysis of the data collected by the Pregnancy Exposure Registry is performed periodically. In addition to the summary, the MAH should provide in the PSUR a copy of the last  interim report of  the  Pregnancy Registry. Preferably, in case of registry for a given product, the data lock point for the analysis will be the same as the data lock point of the PSUR.

In special situations (e.g. exposure to known or suspected teratogens/foetotoxic compounds) a report of the data analysed from the Registry may be requested in intervals more frequent than the PSURs.

Pregnancy outcome should be summarised in a table (see annex 3).

## 5.2.4 Signal detection

The purpose of collection of pregnancy data is to detect certain trends in pregnancy outcome, which could be a signal for specific adverse effects. Therefore, such data should be analysed on a regular basis.

In  the  event  a  signal  is  identified,  the  MAH  is  encouraged  to  inform  the  CHMP  and/or  the  relevant National Competent Authorities. In addition, the MAH is encouraged to provide Statement Report with a scientific assessment of this signal from an appropriate expert with or shortly after submission of the PSUR.

## ANNEX 1 - QUESTIONNAIRE TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON PREGNANCY EXPOSURE

## ANNEX 4 - DEFINITIONS

## A) Terms used to define the foetus at the different stages of the pregnancy

- -Zygote: the single diploid cell formed from the fusion of the ovum and spermatozoon.
- -Preembryo: the first stage of prenatal (see below under foetus) development from conception until  the  end  of  implantation  in  the  uterus  and  the  start  of  organogenesis,  i.e.  until  the postconceptional day 15 or gestational day 29.
- -Embryo: the second stage  of  prenatal  development  including  the  organ-forming  period  (i.e. organogenesis) between gestational day 29 (beginning at 4 completed weeks) and gestational day 84 (i.e. the ending at 12 completed weeks of gestation). The critical period for most major congenital  abnormalities  includes  the  most  vulnerable  period  of  foetal  development,  i.e. organogenesis,  which  occurs  visibly  during  weeks  4  to  12  of  gestation.  However,  each congenital  abnormality  has  its  specific  critical  period,  e.g.  neural  tube  defect  between  the gestational days 29 and 42 (i.e. between days 15 and 28 post-conception).
- -Foetus: this term has two meanings, the narrow definition of foetus reflects the stage of foetal development after organ-forming periods (i.e. organogenesis) until the birth while the broad definition of foetus covers the whole prenatal development from the conception until the birth.

## B) Pregnancy outcome 1

- -Pregnancy  outcome:  the  end  products  of  pregnancy  which  include  three  main  categories: foetal death, termination of pregnancy and live birth.
- -Foetal  death  (intrauterine  death,  in  utero  death):  death  prior  to  complete  expulsion  or extraction  from  its  mother  of  a  product  of  conception,  irrespective  of  the  duration  of pregnancy;  the  death  is  indicated  by  the  fact  that  after  such  separation  the  foetus  does  not show any evidence of life (WHO ICD 10). Early foetal death (before 22 completed weeks of gestation)  comprises  ectopic  pregnancy  and  miscarriage  and  late  foetal  death  (after  22 completed weeks of gestation) is known as stillbirth.
- -Ectopic pregnancy: extrauterine pregnancy, early foetal death most often in the Fallopian tube.
- -Miscarriage: spontaneous abortion, molar pregnancy.
- -Termination  of  pregnancy  (induced  abortion,  elective  abortion):  artificial  interruption  of pregnancy.
- -Live birth: the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy which, after such separation, breathes or shows any evidence of life. (WHO ICD 10).
- -Gestational age or length: the duration of gestation is measured from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Gestational age is expressed in completed days or completed weeks (e.g.  events  occurring  280  to  286  days  after  the  onset  of  the  last  menstrual  period  are considered to have occurred at 40 weeks of gestation).
- -Last menstrual period (abbreviation LMP):  according to international consensus, the gestational age is measured from the first day of the LMP.
- -Birth weight: the initial weight of the infant at birth.
- -Pre-term birth (previous term: premature birth): less than 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation.

1 According to WHO-ICD 10, national regulations might be different

- -Term birth: from 37 to less than 42 completed weeks (259 to 293 days).
- -Post-term birth: 42 completed weeks or more (294 days or more).
- -Low birth weight: less than 2,500 gram (up to and including 2,499 g) of body weight of the newborn at birth.
- -Intrauterine growth retardation (small for gestational age): the observed weight of a live born infant or size of a foetus is lower than expected on the basis of gestational age.

## C) Congenital anomalies (birth defects)

- Congenital anomaly: morphological, functional and/or biochemical developmental disturbance in the embryo or foetus whether detected at birth or not. The term congenital anomaly is broad and  includes congenital abnormalities, foetopathies, genetic diseases with early onset, developmental delay, etc.
- Congenital  abnormality  (structural  birth  defect,  sometimes  congenital  malformation,  foetal defect): a consequence of error of morphogenesis, i.e. structural-morphological defect, grossly or microscopically present at birth whether detected at birth or not.
- Congenital  malformation:  a  morphological  defect  of  an  organ,  part  of  an  organ,  or  larger region of the body resulting from an intrinsically abnormal developmental process.
- Isolated congenital abnormality: a single localised error of morphogenesis.
- Multiple  congenital  abnormalities:  a  concurrence  of  two  or  more  different  morphogenetical errors, i.e. component congenital abnormalities in the same person.
- Teratogens: environmental factors which can cause congenital abnormalities.
- Major abnormalities: a life  threatening  structural  anomaly  or  one  likely  to  cause  significant impairment of health or functional capacity and which needs medical or surgical treatment. The incidence of major abnormalities recognized at birth among liveborn infants is 2%-4% in most series published.
- Minor  anomalies:  relatively  frequent  structural  anomaly  not  likely  to  cause  any  medical  or cosmetic problems.
- Prevalence: number of instances of an occurrence in a given population at a designated time. For convenience these rates are usually multiplied by 1000 or 10,000 to avoid small decimal numbers. The numerator is the number of cases of the subject of interest. The denominator is the population from which the numerator came.
