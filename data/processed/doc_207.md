## Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule for Ages 19 Years or Older, United States, 2025

For vaccination recommendations for persons ages 18 years or younger, see the Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, 2025: www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html

## Additional Information

- y For calculating intervals between doses, 4 weeks = 28 days. Intervals of ≥4 months are determined by calendar months.
- y Within a number range (e.g., 12-18), a dash (-) should be read as 'through.'
- y Vaccine doses administered ≤4 days before the minimum age or interval are considered valid. Doses of any vaccine administered ≥5 days earlier than the minimum age or minimum interval should not be counted as valid and should be repeated. The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by the recommended minimum interval. For further details, see Table 3-2, Recommended and minimum ages and intervals between vaccine doses, in General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization at www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html.
- y Information on travel vaccination requirements and recommendations is available at www.cdc.gov/travel/.
- y For vaccination of persons with immunodeficiencies, see Table 8-1, Vaccination of persons with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, in General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization at www. cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/ immunocompetence.html
- y For information about vaccination in the setting of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak, contact your state or local health department.
- y The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a no-fault alternative to the traditional legal system for resolving vaccine injury claims. All vaccines included in the adult immunization schedule except PPSV23, RSV, RZV, Mpox, and COVID-19 vaccines are covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). Mpox and COVID-19 vaccines are covered by the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). For more information, see www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation or www. hrsa.gov/cicp.

## COVID-19 vaccination

## Shared clinical decision-making

Vaccination based on individual-based decisionmaking-with an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at an increased risk according to the CDC list of COVID-19 risk factors (see www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html). For additional information on shared clinical decision-making, see www.cdc.gov/ acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinicaldecision-making.html

Current COVID-19 schedule and dosage formulation available at www.cdc.gov/covidschedule.

Administer an age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine product for each dose. There is no preferential recommendation for the use of one COVID-19 vaccine over another when more than one recommended age-appropriate vaccine is available.

## Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule for Ages 19 Years or Older, United States, 2025

## Meningococcal vaccination - continued

## Special situations for MenB

- y Anatomical or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), persistent complement component deficiency, complement inhibitor (e.g., eculizumab, ravulizumab) use, or microbiologists routinely exposed to Neisseria meningitidis .
- -Bexsero or Trumenba (use same brand for all doses including booster doses): 3-dose primary series at 0, 1-2, 6 months (if dose 2 was administered at least 6 months after dose 1, dose 3 not needed; if dose 3 is administered earlier than 4 months after dose 2, a 4th dose should be administered at least 4 months after dose 3).
- -Booster doses: 1 booster dose one year after primary series and every 2-3 years if risk remains
- y Pregnancy: Delay MenB until after pregnancy due to lack of safety data in pregnant women. May administer if at increased risk and vaccination benefits outweigh potential risks.

For MenB recommendations in outbreak setting (e.g., in community or organizational settings, or among men who have sex with men) and additional meningococcal vaccination information, see ww.cdc.gov/mmwr/ volumes/69/rr/rr6909a1.htm.

Note: MenB vaccines may be administered simultaneously with MenACWY vaccines if indicated, but at a different anatomic site, if feasible.

Adults may receive a single dose of Penbraya (MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp) as an alternative to separate administration of MenACWY and MenB when both vaccines would be given on the same clinic day. For adults not at increased risk, if Penbraya is used for dose 1 MenB, then MenB-FHbp (Trumenba) should be administered for dose 2 MenB. For adults at increased risk of meningococcal disease, Penbraya may be used for additional MenACWY and MenB doses (including booster doses) if both would be given on the same clinic day and at least 6 months have elapsed since most recent Penbraya dose.

## Monkeypox virus vaccination

## Special situations

- y Any person at risk for monkeypox infection: complete 2-dose series, 28 days apart.

Pregnancy: no recommendation for PCV or PPSV23 due to limited data. Summary of existing data on pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy can be found at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/rr/ rr7203a1.htm.

PPSV23 not available: adults aged 19 years or older who received PCV15 but have not yet completed PPSV23 series, can complete the series with either 1 dose of PCV20 or 1 dose of PCV21 if they no longer have access to PPSV23.

For guidance on determining which pneumococcal vaccines a patient needs and when, please refer to the mobile app which can be downloaded here: www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/hcp/vaccinerecommendations/app.html.

- *Note: Immunocompromising conditions include chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, immunodeficiencies, iatrogenic immunosuppression, generalized malignancy, HIV infection, Hodgkin disease, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, solid organ transplant, congenital or acquired asplenia, or sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies.

## Poliovirus vaccination

## Routine vaccination

- y Adults known or suspected to be unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated: administer remaining doses (1, 2, or 3 IPV doses) to complete a 3-dose primary series.* Unless there are specific reasons to believe they were not vaccinated, most adults who were born and raised in the United States can assume they were vaccinated against polio as children.

## Special situations

- y Adults at increased risk for exposure to poliovirus who completed primary series*: may administer one lifetime IPV booster.
* Note: Complete primary series consists of at least 3 doses of IPV or trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) in any combination.

## Respiratory syncytial virus vaccination

## Routine vaccination

- y Pregnant women of any age:
- -Pregnant at 32 weeks 0 days through 36 weeks and 6 days gestation from September through January in most of the continental United States*: 1 dose Abrysvo . Administer RSV vaccine regardless of previous RSV infection.
- Either maternal RSV vaccination with Abrysvo or infant immunization with nirsevimab (RSV monoclonal antibody) is recommended to prevent severe respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants.
- -All other pregnant women: RSV vaccine not recommended
- -Subsequent pregnancies: additional doses not recommended. No data are available to inform whether additional doses are needed in subsequent pregnancies. Infants born to pregnant women who received RSV vaccine during a previous pregnancy should receive nirsevimab.

*Note: Providers in jurisdictions with RSV seasonality that differs from most of the continental United States (e.g., Alaska, jurisdictions with tropical climate) should follow guidance from public health authorities on timing of administration. Refer to the 2025 Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule for considerations regarding nirsevimab administration to infants.

## Age 75 years or older

- y Unvaccinated: 1 dose (Arexvy or Abrysvo or mResvia). Additional doses not recommended
- y Previously vaccinated: additional doses not recommended. No data are available to inform whether additional doses are needed.

## Special situations

- y Age 60-74 years:
- -Unvaccinated and at increased risk of severe RSV disease**: 1 dose (Arexvy or Abrysvo or mResvia). Additional doses not recommended.
- -Previously vaccinated: additional doses not recommended. No data are available to inform whether additional doses are needed.

Persons 60 years and older can get RSV vaccine at any time but it is best to administer in late summer and early fall before RSV spreads in communities-ideally August through October in most of continental United States. For further guidance, see www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ volumes/73/wr/mm7332e1.htm.

- **Note: People can self-attest to the presence of a risk factor. The following medical and other conditions increase the risk of severe RSV disease:
- Chronic cardiovascular disease e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease. Excludes isolated hypertension.
- Chronic lung or respiratory disease e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, asthma, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis
- End stage renal disease or dependence on hemodialysis or other renal replacement therapy
- Diabetes mellitus complicated by chronic kidney disease, neuropathy, retinopathy, or other end-organ damage
- Diabetes mellitus requiring treatment with insulin or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor
- Neurologic or neuromuscular conditions causing impaired airway clearance or respiratory muscle weakness e.g., post-stroke dysphagia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy. Excludes history of stroke without impaired airway clearance.
- Chronic liver disease e.g., cirrhosis
- Chronic hematologic conditions e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassemia
- Severe obesity (body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2)
- Moderate or severe immune compromise
- Residence in a nursing home
- Other chronic medical conditions or risk factors that a health care provider determines would increase the risk of severe disease due to viral respiratory infection e.g., frailty, concern for presence of undiagnosed chronic medical conditions, residence in a remote or rural community where escalation of medical care is challenging.

## Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination

## Routine vaccination

- y Completed primary series and received at least 1 dose Tdap at age 10 years or older: Td or Tdap every 10 years thereafter
- y Completed primary series and did NOT receive Tdap at age 10 years or older: 1 dose Tdap, then Td or Tdap every 10 years thereafter
- y Unvaccinated or incomplete primary vaccination series for tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis: administer remaining doses (1, 2, or 3 doses) to complete 3-dose primary series. 1 dose Tdap followed by 1 dose Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks later, and a third dose of Td or Tdap 6-12 months later (Tdap is preferred as first dose and can be substituted for any Td dose), then Td or Tdap every 10 years thereafter.

## Special situations

- y Pregnancy: 1 dose Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably in early part of gestational weeks 27-36
- y Wound management: Persons with 3 or more doses of tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine: For clean and minor wounds, administer Tdap or Td if more than 10 years since last dose of tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine; for all other wounds, administer Tdap or Td if more than 5 years since last dose of tetanus-toxoidcontaining vaccine. Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, use Tdap. For detailed information, see www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ volumes/69/wr/mm6903a5.htm

## Varicella vaccination

## Routine vaccination

- y No evidence of immunity to varicella: 2-dose series 4-8 weeks apart if previously did not receive varicellacontaining vaccine (VAR or MMRV [measles-mumpsrubella-varicella vaccine] for children); if previously received 1 dose varicella-containing vaccine, 1 dose at least 4 weeks after first dose.
- -Evidence of immunity: U.S.-born before 1980 (except for pregnant women and health care personnel [see below]), documentation of 2 doses varicella-containing vaccine at least 4 weeks apart, diagnosis or verification of history of varicella or herpes zoster by a health care provider, laboratory evidence of immunity or disease.

## Special situations

- y Pregnancy with no evidence of immunity to varicella: VAR contraindicated during pregnancy; after pregnancy (before discharge from health care facility), 1 dose if previously received 1 dose varicellacontaining vaccine or dose 1 of 2-dose series (dose 2: 4-8 weeks later) if previously did not receive any varicella-containing vaccine, regardless of whether U.S.-born before 1980.
- y Health care personnel with no evidence of immunity to varicella: 1 dose if previously received 1 dose varicella-containing vaccine; 2-dose series 4-8 weeks apart if previously did not receive any varicellacontaining vaccine, regardless of whether U.S.-born before 1980.
- y HIV infection with CD4 percentages ≥15% and CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm 3  with no evidence of immunity: Vaccination may be considered (2 doses 3 months apart); VAR contraindicated for HIV infection with CD4 percentage &lt;15% or CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm 3 .
- y Severe immunocompromising conditions: VAR contraindicated

## Zoster vaccination

## Routine vaccination

- y Age 50 years or older*: 2-dose series recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) 2-6 months apart (minimum interval: 4 weeks; repeat dose if administered too soon), regardless of previous herpes zoster or history of zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax) vaccination.

*Note: Serologic evidence of prior varicella is not necessary for zoster vaccination. However, if serologic evidence of varicella susceptibility becomes available, providers should follow ACIP guidelines for varicella vaccination first. RZV is not indicated for the prevention of varicella, and there are limited data on the use of RZV in persons without a history of varicella or varicella vaccination.

## Special situations

- y Pregnancy: There is currently no ACIP recommendation for RZV use in pregnancy. Consider delaying RZV until after pregnancy.
- y Immunocompromising conditions (including persons with HIV regardless of CD4 count)**: 2-dose series recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) 2-6 months apart (minimum interval: 4 weeks; repeat dose if administered too soon). For detailed information, see www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccineconsiderations/immunocompromised-adults.html

**Note: If there is no documented history of varicella, varicella vaccination, or herpes zoster, providers should refer to the clinical considerations for use of RZV in immunocompromised adults aged ≥19 years and the ACIP varicella vaccine recommendations for further guidance: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/ mm7103a2.htm
