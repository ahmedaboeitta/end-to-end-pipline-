National Guidelines for Management of Drug Resistant TB

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The National Guidelines for Management of Drug Resistant TB have been developed after a series of thorough meetings and deliberations with national experts from the Government of India	(GoI)	and	technical	partners	including	World	Health	Organization	Country	Office	for India (WHO India).

The  National  Technical  Expert  Group  (NTEG)  on  TB  under  the  National  TB  Elimination Programme  (NTEP)  recommended  key  changes  to  the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis released in 2022, which include i) introducing a new 6-month (26 weeks) shorter oral MDR/RR-TB BPaLM regimen containing bedaquiline (Bdq), pretomanid (Pa), linezolid (Lzd),	moxifloxacin	(Mfx)	under	programmatic	condition	ii)	introducing	Bdq	and	delamanid (Dlm) in all age groups considering the unmet need of this population, and iii) replacement of ethionamide (Eto) with Lzd in 9-11 month shorter oral Bdq-containing MDR/RR-TB regimen.

We express our gratitude to Ms. Punya Salila Srivastava, Union Secretary (Health), Ministry of  health  and  family  welfare  (MoHFW), Government of India (GoI); Shri Apurva Chandra, Ex-Union Secretary (Health), MoHFW, GoI; Dr Rajiv Bahl, Secretary (Department of Health Research [DHR] and Director General (DG), Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR); Dr  Atul  Goel,  Director  General  Health  Services  (DGHS),  GoI;  Smt  Aradhana  Patnaik, Additional  Secretary  and  Mission  Director  (National  Health  Mission),  MoHFW,  GoI  ;  Dr Soumya  Swaminathan,  Principal  Advisor  to  NTEP;  Dr  K.

## DEFINITIONS

A second-line TB drug: This drug is reserved for the treatment of drug-resistant TB. First- line TB drugs used to treat drug-susceptible TB - ethambutol, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide may also be used in MDR-TB regimens (streptomycin is now a second-line TB drug and used only as	a	substitute	for	amikacin	when	amikacin	is	not	available	or	there	is	confirmed	resistance to it).

Bacteriologically confirmed TB: TB diagnosed in a biological specimen by smear microscopy, culture, or a WHO-endorsed rapid molecular test adopted by NTEP.

Disseminated  TB: is	 defined	 as	 the	 presence	 of	 TB	 at	 two	 or	 more	 noncontiguous sites  resulting  from  hematogenous  and/or  lymphatic  dissemination  of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis,  occurring  because  of  progressive  primary  infection,  reactivation  of  a  latent focus with subsequent spread, or rarely through iatrogenic origin. Milliary TB is also a form of disseminated TB (1).

Drug-susceptibility testing: DST refers to in-vitro testing using either of the phenotypic methods to determine susceptibility.

Drug resistance testing: DRT refers to in-vitro testing using genotypic methods (molecular techniques) to determine resistance.

Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): TB	caused	by	M.tb	strains	that	fulfil	the	definition of	MDR/RR-TB	and	are	also	resistant	to	any	fluoroquinolone	(levofloxacin	or	moxifloxacin) and at least  one  additional  Group  A  drug  (presently  to  either  bedaquiline  or  linezolid  [or both]) (2).

## Extensive or severe form of TB:

- Extensive TB disease in adults includes presence of bilateral cavitary disease or extensive parenchymal damage on chest radiography &amp; in children under 14 years, presence of cavity or bilateral disease on chest radiography.
- Severe EP-TB disease includes presence of TB-meningitis, or CNS TB, spinal/ skeletal TB, or disseminated TB (miliary TB or TB with multiorgan involvement). Severe EP-TB disease in children under 14 years, extrapulmonary forms of disease other than pleural effusion  &amp;  lymphadenopathy (peripheral nodes or isolated mediastinal mass  without compression).
- In	children,	the	occurrence	of	advanced	malnutrition	(defined	by	syndrome	or	by	metrics) or  advanced  immunosuppression  or  positive  tuberculosis  (TB)  bacteriology  (smear, NAAT, culture) may also be considered when determining disease severity (3).

Isoniazid-resistant TB (Hr-TB): TB is caused by M.tb strains that are resistant to isoniazid, and resistance to rifampicin has been ruled out.

Mono-resistant TB (MR TB): TB	caused	by	M.tb	strains	that	are	resistant	to	one	first-	line anti-TB drug only.

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB): TB caused by M.tb strains that are resistant to both H and R	with	or	without	resistance	to	other	first-line	anti-TB	drugs.	MDR-TB	patients	also	include subsets of Pre-XDR and XDR TB.

Presumptive TB: This  refers  to  a  person  with  any  of  the  symptoms/  signs  or  chest  X-ray Abnormality suggestive of TB.

Presumptive DR-TB: It refers to the patient who is eligible for rifampicin-resistant screening at the time of diagnosis OR/and during treatment for DS-TB or H mono/poly DR-TB. [This includes	 all	 notified	 TB	 patients	 (Public	 and	 private),	 follow-up	 positive	 on	 microscopy including	 treatment	 failures	 on	 standard	 first-	 line	 treatment	 and	 H	 mono/poly	 DR-TB regimen and any clinical non-responder, including paediatric].

Pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (Pre-XDR-TB): TB	caused	by	M.tb	strains	that	fulfil	the definition	of	MDR/	RR-TB	and	are	also	resistant	to	any	fluoroquinolone	(2).

Poly-drug resistant TB (PDR-TB): TB caused by M.tb strains that are resistant to more than one	first-line	anti-TB	drug	other	than	HR	and	RR.

Rifampicin resistant TB (RR-TB): TB caused by M.tb strains that are resistant to R, detected using phenotypic or genotypic methods, with or without resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any resistance to R in the form of mono-resistance, poly-resistance, MDR-TB, or XDR-TB.

Serious adverse events: SAEs	are	those	adverse	events	(AEs)	classified	as	Grade	3	(severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) or Grade 5 (death related to AE) or which led to the drug	being	stopped	permanently.	SAEs	are	otherwise	often	defined	as	AEs	that	either	leads to death or a life-threatening experience; to initial or prolonged hospitalization; to persistent or	significant	disability;	or	to	a	congenital	anomaly.	The	management	of	SAEs	may	require	the termination of the drug suspected of having caused the event.

Universal DST: Refers to universal access to rapid DRT for at least rifampicin and further DST/DRT	 for	 at	 least	 fluoroquinolones	 among	 all	 TB	 patients	 with	 rifampicin	 resistance (preferably before initiation of treatment to a maximum within 15 days of diagnosis).

## 1 INTRODUCTION

## 1.1.  Global and national recommendations on newer shorter oral regimens

In recent years, India has made far-reaching progress in the management of TB. For example, an injectionfree fully oral treatment regimen for drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) has been implemented across the country. In 2023, among 25.52 lakh TB patients diagnosed, 24.38 lakh (95.5%) patients were put on treatment (4). The	disaggregated	treatment	success	rate	of	patients	notified	from	the	public	and	private	sectors,	with	the current standard of care for drug susceptible TB i.e. 6-month regimen (two months initiation phase consists of isoniazid [H], rifampicin [R], pyrazinamide [Z], ethambutol [E] followed by four months HRE), are 85% and 87%, respectively (5).

The National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) succeeded in retaining its focus on the goal of ending TB amidst the pandemic. The programme effectively utilized every opportunity of the integrated health system approach, the key to the resilience of India's health system during the pandemic (5).

The emergence of drug resistance is a major threat to global efforts to end TB (2)(3). Resistance to H and R	-	the	two	most	effective	first-line	anti-TB	drugs	(FLDs)-	is	of	greatest	concern.	For	more	than	ten	years, the best estimate of the proportion of people diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB among newly diagnosed TB has remained at about 3-4%, and among those diagnosed with previously treated TB has remained at about 18-21%	globally	(6).	In	2023,	five	countries	accounted	for	more	than	half	of	the	global	number	of	people estimated to have developed MDR/RR-TB in 2023: India (27%), the Russian Federation (7.4%), Indonesia (7.4%), China (7.3%) and the Philippines (7.2%). The estimates of MDR/RR-TB in India have reduced by 20% from 1.40 lakh in 2015 to 1.10 lakh in 2023, with an estimated proportion of new TB cases with MDR/RR-TB at 2.5% and of previously treated TB cases with MDR/RR-TB at 13% as per the WHO Global TB Report 2024 (7)(8).

India has made considerable progress in expanding diagnostic and treatment services for DR- TB in the last decade. In 2023, 63,929 MDR/RR-TB including 11,749 pre-XDR-TB and 114 XDR-TB patients; and 23,019 H-mono/poly DR-TB patients were diagnosed. The treatment success rate of MDR-TB patients has improved from 49% in the 2017 to 75% in patients in the 2021 (4). Treatment of XDR-TB presents multiple challenges to clinicians and national TB programmes (NTPs) because of the limited range of medicines available and the life-threatening nature of the disease. Patients with MDR/RR-TB and additional FQ resistance have typically experienced	poor	treatment	outcomes	since	XDR-TB	was	first	described	in	2006	(9).	With	the	introduction of newer drug-containing regimens, there has been a remarkable improvement in the treatment success of Pre-XDR-TB (erstwhile XDR-TB) patients, from 36% in the 2017 to 68% in the 2021. India reported a 73% treatment success rate in patients enrolled on longer oral M/XDR-TB regimens during 2021 (5). This has given better chances of survival to patients with MDR-TB.

## 1.1.1  WHO recommendations on new, shorter, oral regimens

All	patients	with	MDR/RR-TB,	including	those	with	additional	resistance	to	fluoroquinolones,	need	to	benefit from  effective  all-oral  treatment  regimens,  either  shorter  or  longer,  implemented  under  programmatic conditions.  The  2022  update  of  the  DR-TB  treatment  guidelines  added  and  prioritized  a  new  6-month regimen - BPaLM(7) , as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. (10).

In 2022, WHO recommended that all patients with MDR/RR-TB, including those with additional resistance to	FQ,	stand	to	benefit	from	effective	all-oral	treatment	regimens,	either	shorter	or	longer,	implemented under programmatic conditions. The 6-month BPaLM regimen, comprising Bdq, Pa, Lzd (600 mg) and Mfx, may	be	used	programmatically	in	place	of	9-11	month	or	longer	(≥	18	months)	regimens	in	patients	(aged	≥14 years)	with	MDR/RR-TB	who	have	not	had	previous	exposure	to	Bdq,	Pa	and	Lzd	(defined	as	more	than	one month exposure)(9).

WHO recommended that the nine-month, all-oral, Bdq- containing regimens are preferred over the longer (≥	18	months)	regimen	in	adults	and	children	with	MDR/	RR-TB,	without	previous	exposure	to	second-line treatment (including Bdq), without FQ resistance and with no extensive pulmonary TB disease or severe EPTB and in patients where BPaLM cannot be given. In this regimen, two months of Lzd (600 mg) to be used as an alternative to four months of Eto (9).

Patients  with  XDR-TB  or  those  who  are  not  eligible  for  or  have  failed  shorter  treatment  regimens  will be	 considered	 for	 designing	 longer	 oral	 regimen	 (≥18	 months)	 using	 the	 priority	 grouping	 of	 medicines recommended in current WHO guidelines (11).

## 1.1.2  Recommendations of the national technical expert group under NTEP

The  national  technical  expert  group  (NTEG)  under  NTEP,  considering  the  WHO  recommendations,  has recommended for developing a protocol with guidance document for (i) introducing BPaLM regiman under programmatic condition (ii) introducing Bdq and Dlm in all age groups considering the unmet need of this population, and (iii) adopting the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR-TB regimen with Lzd replacing Eto. In August 2024, the NTEG also recommended introducing CBNAAT M.tb/XDR test for rapid molecular detection of resistance to H, FQ, SLI and Eto at laboratories equipped with the technology.

## CASE FINDING AND DIAGNOSIS OF DRUG-SUSCEPTIBLE AND DRUG-RESISTANT TB 2

Early  diagnosis  and  prompt  treatment  will  prevent  the  patient  from  spreading  the  disease  to  others, developing resistance to more drugs, progressing to a chronic state of permanent lung damage and ultimately prevent	mortality	due	to	the	disease.	A	patient	is	confirmed	to	have	DR-TB	when	the	results	are	from	NTEPendorsed and quality-assured NAAT or Culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing (C&amp;DST) utilizing  NTEPendorsed testing method in public and private facilities.

Diagnosis	of	TB	is	difficult	in	certain	key	groups	of	the	presumptive	TB	patients	like	extra-pulmonary,	people living  with  HIV  (PLHIV),  children,  smear  -ve  /NA  with  X-ray  abnormalities  suggestive  of  TB,  and  other vulnerable	groups	as	defined	in	national	guidelines	and	DR-TB	contacts,	hence,	NAAT	is	offered	upfront	for diagnosis of TB among these presumptive TB patients. Currently the program follows upfront molecular testing for all presumptive TB.

Patients considered for inclusion in various regimens would be diagnosed using available rapid molecular tests	and	liquid	C&amp;DST	for	the	drugs	as	specified	in	the	integrated	diagnostic	and	treatment	algorithm	for DS and DR-TB (Fig. 2.1).

## Foot Notes to Diagnostic Algorithm:

1. Includes  TB  patients  diagnosed  based  on  smear  microscopy,  clinical/  radiological  assessment,  and histopathology on appropriate specimen
2. Presumptive TB includes a person with any of the symptoms, signs or any chest X-ray abnormalities suggestive of TB. States to accelerate upfront use of chest X-rays for screening and use of NAAT for TB diagnosis.
3. Sputum (two specimens), gastric lavage (GL), induced sputum (IS), broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), other respiratory	 specimen	 and	 extra	 pulmonary	 specimen	 like	 fine	 needle	 aspiration	 cytology	 (FNAC)	 of peripheral	lymph	nodes	(LNs)	and	cerebrospinal	fluid	(CSF),	to	be	sent	to	NAAT	site	for	M.tb/Rif,	followed by
- i. NAAT for H, FQ resistance detection among M.tb detected using the same specimen, wherever the test is available and as per algorithm.
- ii. Until NAAT for H, FQ resistance detection is available for the district, send second specimen for FL-LPA for H resistance detection among M.tb detected followed by SL-LPA for FQ, SLI resistance detection among H or R resistance detected
- iii. Baseline culture to be done for specimen from MDR-TB patients received at C&amp;DST lab for baseline liquid culture (LC) DST to Bdq*, Lzd, Pa*, Dlm*, Z, Mfx 1.0 (*whenever available) and for specimen from H mono/poly DR-TB patients received at C&amp;DST lab for baseline (LC) DST to Mfx 1.0, Lzd, Z.
- iv. All EP-TB specimens except FNAC of peripheral LNs and CSF preferably to be sent directly to C&amp;DST laboratory for further processing. (3).
- v. Start treatment based on NAAT for H, FQ resistance detection / LPA and modify based on LC-DST results whenever available.
- vi. InhA mutation is associated with Eto resistance and KatG mutation is associated with Hh resistance. If FL-LPA is done on culture isolates for patients with smear negative specimen, till the time the result of indirect FL-LPA is available, use other exclusion criteria to decide regimen. Results of Mfx, Am and Eto will be interpreted as per the mutation pattern of rapid molecular test/ LPA.
4. Eligibility criteria for BPaLM has been mentioned in the respective section of Chapter-3.
5. Implementation considerations/ Extension criteria for BPaLM (Details have been mentioned in section BPaLM respective section of Chapter-3).
6. Eligibility  criteria  for  9-11  month  shorter  oral  MDR/RR-TB  regimen  have  been  mentioned  in  the respective section of Chapter-3)
7. At follow-up, offer LC-DST for Bdq*, Lzd, Pa*, Dlm*, Z, Mfx 1.0 (*whenever available).
- All  states  must  ensure  the  availability  of  all  NTEP-endorsed  diagnostic  technologies  or  appropriate linkages  with  public  or  private  laboratories  to  ensure  adequate  diagnostic  and  follow-up  capacity  in consultation	with	CTD	for	all	notified	TB	patients,	including	those	seeking	care	in	the	private	sector.
- In a new case, if M.tb detected is low or very low and RR-TB detected, NAAT to be repeated and an opinion from a microbiologist may also be sought. If there is a discordance in R resistance between NAAT and FL LPA, a second NAAT is to be performed at the C&amp;DST laboratory using the decontaminated deposit, or	fresh	sample	to	be	sent	if	culture	deposits	are	not	available.	The	final	result	will	be	on	consensus	of the	3	tests	(2	NAAT	and	1	LPA).	If	2	of	3	are	R	resistant	then	the	final	result	will	be	R	resistant;	if	2	of	3 are	sensitive,	then	the	final	result	will	be	sensitive	to	R	and	the	treatment	will	be	started	as	based	on best of three results. Further, the C&amp;DST report whenever available may be reviewed by N/DDR-TBC committee to decide on the treatment regimen. (3).

- I. Evidence on newer oral drugs and regimens for treatment of drug-resistant TB
- II. Shorter regimens general considerations
- III. The new 6-month shorter oral regimen BPaLM for the treatment of MDR-TB
- IV. Highlights the key changes in 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen,

The decisions for enrolment on the BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter MDR/ RR-TB regimen or 18 month longer M/ XDR-TB regimen will be made by the nodal DR-TB centre (NDR-TBC) or district DR-TB centre  (DDRTBC) in consultation with respective N/DDR-TBC committee, as deemed necessary, based on the results of the molecular and/ or LC-DST (a single breakpoint concentration based for FQ) for second- line anti-TB drugs (SLD) for individual patient and the eligibility criteria. All DR-TB patients need to be assessed at the time of treatment initiation as per the guidance document for differentiated TB care.

Decisions on appropriate regimens should be made considering the results of DRT/ DST, clinical assessment, patient  treatment  history,  risk  of  adverse  events,  severity,  and  site  of  the  disease.  To  assess  regimen effectiveness, all treatment services under NTEP should be delivered including patient- centered care and support, informed decision-making process where necessary, principles of good clinical practice, active drug safety monitoring and management (aDSM), and regular monitoring of patients (12).

## 3.1.  Evidence on newer oral drugs and regimens for treatment of drug-resistant TB

- The NIX-TB trial (13) with three drugs Bdq, Pretomanid (Pa) and Lzd [BPaL] has shown 90% treatment success  rate  in  patients  with  Pre-XDR-TB  (erstwhile  XDR-TB)  patients  and  MDR-TB  patients  with treatment intolerance or nonresponse to standard treatment. The toxic effects of Lzd (1200 mg) include peripheral neuropathy (occurring in 81% of patients) and myelosuppression (48%), although common, were manageable, often leading to dose reductions or interruptions in treatment with Lzd.
- Two more studies viz, TB PRACTECAL trial (14) and ZeNix trial (15) were published and reviewed by the WHO guidelines development group (GDG). It was recommended the optimal dosing of Lzd is 600 mg	daily	to	ensure	optimal	efficacy	(91%	treatment	success	rate),	with	the	possibility	of	dose	reduction

- in the event of toxicity or poor tolerability (peripheral neuropathy occurred in 24%, myelosuppression occurred	in	2%,	and	the	Lzd	dose	was	modified	i.e.,	interrupted	or	reduced	in	13%)	(11).
- TB PRACTECAL trial (14) with the 6-month BPaLM regimen - comprising Bdq, Pa, Lzd (600 mg) and Mfx	-	showed	favourable	efficacy	(treatment	success	rate	88.7%)	and	safety	(19.4%	grade	&gt;	3	adverse events as against 58.9% in the prevailing WHO standard of care) when compared with the regimens in the control arm of the TB-PRACTECAL trial. Evidence has largely revealed that the optimal dosing of Lzd is 600 mg daily. It also alleviated previous concerns on reproductive toxicities observed in animal studies (11).
- Modified	BPaL	(mBPaL)	trial,	a	pragmatic	randomized	clinical	trial,	randomized	participants	to	the	three arms with Bdq, Pa and different Lzd doses; arm 1 had Lzd 600 mg for 26 weeks; arm 2 had Lzd 600 mg for 9 weeks &amp; 300 mg for 17 weeks and arm 3 had Lzd 600 mg for 13 weeks &amp; 300 mg daily for 13 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the effectiveness (cure) was similar across the three arms; 93% in BPaL in arm 1, 94% in BPaL in arm 2 and 93% in BPaL in arm 3. The study observed that the median (interquartile range) time for the occurrence of anemia was 4 weeks (2-6 weeks) and peripheral neuropathy was 11 weeks (4-16 weeks). Severe anemia (grade 3 or 4) was more in patients in arm 1 (13%) compared to arms 2 &amp; 3 (4%, 6%). The anemia events were manageable in all the three arms. Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was observed in 7 patients in arm 1 compared to one each in arms 2 &amp; 3. The study showed that Lzd related toxicity could be reduced with structured dose reduction of Lzd from 600 mg to 300mg after 9/ 13 weeks while maintaining similar treatment effectiveness as Lzd 600mg when given along with Bdq and Pa for 26 weeks (16).
- The study for cost-effectiveness found that in most settings, BPaL-based regimens are cost-saving (17). It has	been	appreciated	that	BPaL	would	reduce	workload	and	financial	burden	on	the	health	care	system, expressed	 concerns	 regarding	 BPaL	 safety	 (monitoring),	 long-term	 efficacy,	 and	 national	 regulatory requirements, and stressed the importance of addressing current health systems constraints as well, especially in treatment and safety monitoring systems (18).
- The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted Health Technology Assessment (HTA) for cost- effectiveness of BPaLM/ BPaL treatment regimen for MDR/RR-TB and following key observations were reported:
- i. Emerging global evidence suggests that 6-month Bedaquiline containing regimens BPaL and BPaLM are cost-effective, and improve compliance and clinical outcomes in drug resistant TB patients.
- ii. As  compared  with  currently  deployed  treatment  protocols,  the  BPaL/BPaLM  regimens  are  cost effective.
- iii. Pragmatic uptake of the above regimen could improve treatment success rate for MDR/RR-TB and free up resources for investment in other areas of TB programme.
- iv. Introduction of BPaL and BPaLM regimens in the TB elimination mission merits consideration on priority.
- Routine data from the South African NTP for a 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen containing Bdq,  FQ  and  Lzd  (600  mg)  combined  with  other  medicines  used  in  MDR/RR-TB  patients  without resistance to FQ without previous exposure to SLDs was compared with the existing recommended 9-11 month, all- oral, Bdq-containing regimen (which contains Eto instead of Lzd) or longer regimens in the same group of patients. It included mostly adult patients (96%) and a high proportion of PLHIV (67%). The data showed that replacing four - six months of Eto with two months of Lzd in this regimen resulted in	similar	treatment	efficacy	and	safety.	The	outcomes	were	similar,	irrespective	of	HIV	status.	(11).
- Based on data reviewed from TMC207-C211 and IMPAACT P1108 trials, corresponding the use of Bdq in children aged 5-18 years and aged 0-6 years, respectively, the WHO GDG concluded that in children 0-6 years of age, cardiac safety signals were not distinct from those reported in adults. Data from pediatric MDR/RR-TB individual patient data (IPD) were analyzed descriptively (24,231 records from all six WHO regions, the majority from India and South Africa) in April 2020, including 40 children aged below six years and 68 children aged 6-12 years who received Bdq as part of DR-TB treatment.

The moderately desirable effects of Bdq in all-oral regimens for children will allow the construction of regimens that are more child- and family-friendly, with shorter durations. The WHO GDG determined that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects probably favoured the use of Bdq in children aged below six years and was probably feasible to implement (19).

- On review of data on the use of Dlm in children from cohorts 1 (age 12-17 years), 2 (age 6-11 years), 3 (age 3-5 years) and 4 (age 0-2 years) for both protocols (protocol 242-12-232 and 233), the WHO GDG noted that exposures in the 0-2 year age group were lower than those of children aged three years and older, necessitating a modelling/simulation approach to dosing. No cardiac safety signals, distinct from those reported in adults, were observed in children 0-2 years of age. However, pharmacodynamic simulations suggested that clinically meaningful changes in QT (i.e. prolongation) would be unlikely in children under three years of age, even if higher doses were used to reach drug exposures comparable to those achieved in adults. The GDG concluded that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects probably favours the intervention (19).
- The chronology of events for introduction of Pa containing regimen in India can be found in annexure 1.

## 3.2 General consideration for treatment of drug resistant TB

- For	MDR/RR-TB,	in	patients	aged	14	years	or	more,	26-39	weeks	BPaLM	is	the	first	preference	and	in patients	aged	&lt;14	years	09-11	month	shorter	oral	is	first	preference	based	on	the	eligibility	criteria (described in the relevant section for BPaLM and 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen) (3).
- Patients who are not eligible for the BPaLM regimen should be assessed for the eligibility of the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen, and if found ineligible, they should be considered for longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen based on the DST pattern.
- The DR-TB regimens will be provided by the N/DDR-TBC committee in the designated public sector facilities	and	engaged	private	sector	facilities	once	the	patient	has	been	confirmed	as	eligible.	Each	of the N/DDR-TBCs must ensure that laboratory capacity and consultancy services from various specialists are available, either in-house, supported under institutional/ state government mechanisms or through an  outsourced  mechanism.  The  engagement  with  private  facilities  as  per  guidance  document  on partnerships 2019 should also be undertaken for investigations and specialist consultations that are not available in public health facilities (20).
- Selection of the treatment regimen is to be based on comprehensive analysis of lab report for NAAT/ LPA/  LC-DST,  pre-treatment  evaluation,  Inclusion-exclusion  criteria,  past  h/o  drug  use,  absolute  and relative contra-indication.
- All  patients are to be assessed for selection of appropriate regimen and for hospital admission using differentiated TB care approach.

## 3.2.1  Pre-treatment evaluation

All MDR/RR-TB patients would be subjected to a thorough pre-treatment evaluation (PTE) at the N/DDRTBCs as per table 3.1 below.

Table 3.1: The list of the PTE for MDR/RR-TB patients

| Clinical evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Laboratory-based evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

- A  brief  peripheral  neuropathy  screening  tool,  annexure-3,  is  to  be  used  to  assess  the  peripheral neuropathy (21). 'Division of AIDS (DAIDS) table for grading the severity of adult and paediatric adverse events' 2017, by National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human Services,  may be referred for grades of neuropathy and anemia (22).

## 3.2.2  Treatment initiation

- All patients diagnosed as MDR/RR-TB using various technologies will be evaluated and initiated on an appropriate regimen with eligibility criteria as per the integrated diagnostic and treatment algorithm for DS and DR-TB.
- Once	a	patient	is	identified	as	per	the	eligibility	criteria,	the	N/DDR-TBC	committee	will	start	the	patient on BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen or 18-20 months longer oral regimen.
- Till	Bdq	is	available	for	the	use	in	children	below	five	years	and	evidences	for	the	use	of	Pa	among		below 14 years, the other regimens as applicable will be used.
- The decision to initiate treatment will be taken by the nodal DR-TB centre (NDR-TBC) or district DR-TB centre (DDR-TBC) in consultation with respective N/DDR-TBC committee.
- All  eligible  patients  will  be  offered  thorough  counselling  along  with  educational  material  in  the  local language, which will give details of the nature and duration of treatment, including information on the BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen or 18-20 month longer oral regimen, the need for regular treatment, possible side effects of the drugs in the regimen, the drugs which are to be avoided and the consequences of irregular treatment or premature termination of treatment. Female patients in reproductive age-group will receive additional counselling on family planning. The patient-wise box with bottles and strips for the entire course will remain under the custody of the treatment supporter for the entire duration of treatment.
- As Bdq has a longer half-life (calculated half-life is 24 to 30 hours and terminal half-life of 5.5 months due to extensive tissue distribution post stopping BDQ), any interruption in treatment may lead to early washing out of other drugs while Bdq remains in the body leading to monotherapy with Bdq with higher

risk	 of	 Bdq	 resistance	 amplification.	 Hence,	 it	 is	 strongly	 recommended	 that	 all	 treatment	 regimens, including BPaLM doses are to be administered under direct observation (minimum 6 days per week) by a	trained	treatment	supporter	(health	care	provider,	community	volunteer)	identified	by	the	community health	officer	 (CHO)	of	the	respective	Ayushman	Arogya	Mandir	(AAM,	erstwhile	health	&amp;	wellness centre, HWC). The treatment supervision may be supplemented by suitable digital adherence monitoring technology (3). It will be preferable for the treatment supporters to accompany the patient/ contacts for the screening and follow-up visits and liaise with the clinical staff.

Monitoring indicator: Administer at-least 85% of doses under direct physical supervision by the treatment supporter.

- It is recommended to avoid taking magnesium supplements or magnesium-containing antacids for two hours before and two hours after taking any regimen as it can bind the FQs and make them ineffective (23).

## 3.3 BPaLM regimen

BPaLM	regimen	must	be	the	first	choice	of	treatment	in	eligible	patients	≥14	years	age	with	MDR/RR-	TB regardless of their FQ resistance status or HIV status.

## Note:

- In case of extensive pulmonary TB, BPaLM regimen may be given, if eligible.
- If at baseline, the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology or urinalysis are outside the normal reference range (including above listed parameters), the patient may still be considered if the physician judges	that	the	abnormalities	or	deviations	from	normal	to	be	not	clinically	significant	or	to	be	appropriate and reasonable. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to a patient receiving any QTc prolonging drugs.

In addition to the eligibility criteria for BPaLM, the relative contraindications, requiring careful selection of patients after a detailed history of the patient (drug, comorbidity, concurrent use of any drugs, etc.), physical assessment in combination with PTE test, are detailed in Table 3.2.

## 3.3.2  Regimen, dosage, and administration

- BPaLM regimen is to be administered orally with food (avoid magnesium supplements or magnesium -containing antacids before and after 2 hrs) and adequate water intake.
- Pyridoxine  supplementation  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  neuropathy  in  patients, supporting its inclusion in treatment protocols to mitigate drug-induced neuropathy. Pyridoxine to be used in the BPaLM regimen to provide added protection against neuropathy.

- The dosages of the drugs in the regimen are as follows (14,16,24,25):
- i. Bedaquiline
-  Weeks one to two: 400 mg once daily
-  Weeks three to 26/39*: 200 mg three times a week; plus
- ii. Pretomanid:
-  Weeks one to 26/39*: 200 mg daily; plus
- iii. Linezolid:
-  Weeks one to 26/39*: 600 mg once daily; plus
- iv. Moxifloxacin:
-  Weeks one to 26/39*: 400 mg once daily

* Extension criteria has been described in subsequent section.

## Pyridoxine (Pdx) to be given as per weight band:

Body weight

16-29kg

&gt; 30 kg

Dose

50mg

100mg

- All patients aged 14 years and above would receive the above standard dosage. There is no weight band wise dosing.

## 3.3.3  Dose Reduction of Lzd (16):

- All the efforts are to be made to continue the regimen with Lzd 600 mg throughout the course.
- i. If Lzd 600 mg can't be continued, because of grade 03/ grade 04 toxicity, up to 09 weeks, the regimen is to be declared as treatment failed.
- ii. The dose reduction of Lzd to 300 mg, because of grade 03/ grade 04 toxicity, can be considered only after 09 weeks.
- iii. If dose of Lzd is reduced to 300 mg the period of the regimen will be extended upto 39 weeks
- In  the  initial  days  of  treatment,  myelosuppression  due  to  Lzd  sets  earlier  compared  to  peripheral neuropathy. If, Hb falls less than 8g/dl and responds to blood transfusion, the patient can be continued with Lzd 600 mg with intensive monitoring.

## 3.3.4  Regimen Change as per DST:

- Since Bdq and Lzd resistance levels in India are low, the NTEG recommended that BPaLM regimen can be initiated in all the eligible MDR-TB patients while awaiting baseline DST to these drugs.
- In case the baseline DST shows resistance to any of the Bdq / Pa/Lzd, the outcome will be declared as "Treatment regimen changed" and the patient is considered for 18-20 months longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen, after assessment at N/DDRTBC.

## 3.3.5  Moxifloxacin in BPaLM:

- Mfx is a part of BPaLM regimen for full course, irrespective of resistance pattern to FQ at baseline or during the course of the regimen. The following are the supporting evidence for the continuation of Moxifloxacin	in	BPaLM	regimen	irrespective	of	FQ	resistance	pattern:

## A. TB PRACTECAL study:

-  TB PRACTECAL trial had 3 arms including BPaLM, BPaLC, BPaL compared with the WHO standard of care. In the BPaLM arm 32/138 participants (23%) were FQ resistant and Mfx continued throughout the treatment duration in all 138 patients irrespective of FQ resistance status.

-  Culture conversion: Culture conversion at 12 weeks was observed for 99/121 (82%) patients for	whom	conversion	could	be	defined	in	the	standard	care	group	and	107/120	(89%)	patients	in the	BPaLM	group	(risk	difference	7.3	percentage	points	[95%	CI	-1.5	to	16.2]	(26).	In	stage	1	of the trial, the percentages of patients with culture conversion in liquid medium at 8 weeks after randomization were 77%, 67%, and 46% in the BPaLM, BPaLC, and BPaL groups, respectively. 78 of 99 patients in the standard-care group (79%) and 85 of 96 patients in the BPaLM group (88%) had culture conversion at 12 weeks (14).
-  Comparable time to culture conversion: Median time to culture conversion was 56 days (IQR 28 to 83 days) in the standard care group and 55 days (IQR 28 to 57 days) in the BPaLM group (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.38 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.81] (26).
-  Low	recurrence	and	probable	protection	against	amplification	of	bedaquiline	resistance:	In	TB PRACTECAL trial, disease recurrence was observed in 5/115 (4%) participants in the BPaLC group, 4/111 (4%) participants in the BPaL group and 1/138 (1%) participants in BPaLM group. New resistance to bedaquiline was observed in three of four isolates from the participants with disease recurrence, all were in the BPaL group; of these, an isolate from one participant also showed resistance to clofazimine (26). At week 48, there were no recurrences of tuberculosis in the BPaLM group (14). Also sustained treatment success was observed with BPaLM at 108 weeks (94%) after randomization in patients resistant to FQ (26).
-  Better treatment outcome: The network meta-analysis found successful outcomes in 55/62 (89%) patients treated with BPaLM compared with 46/60 (77%) patients of those treated with BPaL (absolute risk reduction 1.15 [95% CI 0.95-1.38]) (26).
-  The safety outcomes also favoured BPaLM, with lower percentages of patients with adverse events of grade 3 or higher or serious adverse events for all outcomes (at week 72, at week 108, and during treatment) (14).
-  The QTcF interval at week 24 was lower in the BPaLM group than in the standard-care group and more closely resembled the QTcF in the BPaL group. The QTcF in the BPaLC group was similar to that	in	the	standard-care	group.	This	finding	corroborates	evidence	suggesting	that	clofazimine	is	a primary driver of QTcF prolongation in bedaquiline-containing regimens (14).

## B. US programmatic data (27)

-  CDC report compares patients who were initiated on the BPaLM regimen in the USA between 2019 and 2022, with patients receiving BPaL, a regimen previously documented to have uptake in US tuberculosis programmes, as a complement to the randomised TB-PRACTECAL study.
-  84/116 (72%) patients with BPaL regimen and 29/36 (81%) patients with BPaLM regimen completed treatment
-  TB relapse reported was 3% in BPaL regimen and 0% in BPaLM regimen in the above cohort.
-  TB death reported was 1% in BPaL regimen and 3% in BPaLM regimen in the above cohort.

## 3.3.6  BPaLM regimen implementation considerations/ extension criteria/ regimen modification

- i. Folllow up cultures are to be done at the month 9,13, 18, 22, 26, and 39 in case of extension. However, if  patients  on  BPaLM  show  clinical  deterioration  or  no  improvement  by  9  weeks,  send  an  additional specimen for smear, rapid molecular test, C&amp;DST to all drugs at 9 weeks.
- ii. At any point, after 9 weeks, if the patient is not improving clinically or radiologically, send sputum/ EPTB specimen for C&amp;DST and refer the patient to N/DDR-TBC.
- iii. Interruptions: All possible efforts should be made to support the patient and manage the adverse events to ensure uninterrupted treatment and intake of all medicines in the regimen. However, when severe toxicity occurs, the medicine should be stopped.

- a. In case of treatment interruptions and extended treatment duration to make up for missed doses, it is necessary for patients to complete the 26 weeks of prescribed doses within 30 weeks and for patients in whom treatment is extended, it is necessary to complete 39 weeks of prescribed doses within 43 weeks.
- b. If	above	conditions	are	not	fulfilled,	the	patient	may	be	declared	as	treatment	failed	and	considered for an appropriate treatment regimen change at the N/DDR-TBC.
- iv. Missed Doses: Patient must complete 26 weeks (182 days) / 39 weeks (273 days) of treatment period with all core medicines i.e., B, Pa, L. In case of missed doses in BPaLM regimen, the following general guidance should be considered:
- a. Patient must be resumed and complete the BPaLM course by prolonging the treatment duration for number of missed doses of any core drugs in the regimen i.e., B, Pa, L in the following conditions:
5.  Consecutive treatment interruption of up to two weeks or
6.  Non-consecutive cumulative treatment interruption of up to four weeks

In the event of treatment interruption of the regimen, re-introduction of the regimen could be considered post-cessation within 4 weeks after re-assessment of the patient by the N/DDR TBC.

- b. In following conditions of missed doses of any core drugs i.e., B, Pa, L, the regimen is not resumed.
2.  &gt;2-weeks	of	consecutive	treatment	interruption;	or
3.  &gt;4-weeks	cumulative	of	nonconsecutive	treatment	interruption.

## Further,

-  treatment outcome to be declared as treatment regimen changed.
-  the patient to be sent for clinical review and assessment at NDR-TBC to consider for 18-20 months longer oral M/ XDR-TB regimen. The outcome of only the changed regimen would be reported.
- v. Dose	modification	of	Bdq,	Pa,	and	Mfx	is	not	recommended	during	treatment.
- vi. For intolerance (grade 3-4) to FQ: Drop Mfx, complete the rest of the regimen as BPaL and extend the treatment to 39 weeks.
- vii.  For intolerance (grade 3-4) to LZD Dose:  All efforts must be made to ensure that the dosage of Lzd 600mg daily to be continued for the entire duration of treatment.
- a. Within	the	first	9	weeks	of	treatment	initiation,	if	Lzd	(600	mg	daily)	need	to	be	discontinued,	due	to severe/ grade 03 toxicity (myelosuppression and/or peripheral neuropathy or optic neuritis), despite efforts to restart Lzd at 600 mg, then discontinue the BPaLM regimen and declare the outcome as 'treatment failed'. The patient must be sent to the NDR-TBC for further evaluation and management.
- b. For grade 03/ grade 04 toxicity/ intolerance due to Lzd (600 mg daily) in patients after 9 weeks of treatment initiation: -
-  All efforts must be made to ensure that the patient consumes Lzd at full or lower dose up to at least 26-39 weeks of treatment.
-  The patient must be sent to the N/DDR-TBC for detailed assessment regarding the temporary interruption, reintroduction of Lzd at full dose. If reintroduction at full dose is not possible, lower dose of Lzd to 300 mg.
-  In case of reduction in the dose of Linezolid, the treatment must be extended upto 39 weeks and the patient must be followed up, more frequently by the physician clinically, radiologically and microbiologically.

In general,  action for Lzd toxicity should be taken in the following manner:

- for optic neuritis diagnosed at any grade, permanent discontinuation of linezolid is indicated;
- for peripheral neuropathy Grade 2, reduce the dose of linezolid to 300 mg per day with a possible drug holiday for 1-2 weeks before dose reduction;
- for peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 or 4, in most cases permanent suspension of linezolid will be needed; in some cases, after a 1-2-week drug holiday and reversion to Grade 2, the linezolid can be restarted and tolerated, provided it does not revert back to a Grade 3 or 4 (caution is warranted with this approach because patients can be left with a severe painful and disabling permanent peripheral neuropathy); and
- myelosuppression  (even  of  Grade  3  or  4)  is  often  reversible  with  a  short  1-to-2-week  drug  holiday followed by reducing the dose of linezolid to 300 mg per day; severe anaemia may need to be treated with transfusions or erythropoietin.

An example of changes in Lzd dosing within the BPaLM regimen are given in Box 3.1 below-

## Box 3.1. Example of changes in linezolid dosing within the BPaLM regimen

A patient diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB (based on NAAT results) completes four weeks of treatment with BPaLM, with 600 mg of Lzd, when she/he experience symptoms of severe paresthesia in the feet, preventing  her/his  from  completing  daily  life  activities. This	adverse		event		necessitates		the	cessation	of	Lzd	within	the	first	9	weeks	of	therapy. Because permanent discontinuation of Lzd was needed, the entire regimen had to be discontinued,  the  treatment  outcome  to  be  declared  as  failed  and  a  new  regimen  as applicable to be started.

- viii. After all efforts, in case the side-effects are worsening, the regimen must be stopped and the patient must be shifted to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen by the N/DDR TB Center. In the event of intolerance (grade 3 or 4) to Bdq, Pa or Lzd, when re-challenge is not possible within 4 weeks of de-challenge to address the intolerance or when resistance is detected, discontinue BPaLM regimen permanently and declare the outcome as 'treatment failed. Permanent discontinuation of Bdq, Pa or Lzd because of grade 3 or 4 ADR, drug resistance at any point of time, the patient must be declared as 'treatment failure' and referred to NDR-TBC for evaluation.
- ix. Patients'  screening  for  Lzd  ADR:  Patients  must  be  actively  screened  for  any  early  development  of Linezolid induced adverse events especially myelosuppression and neuropathy.
- a. This is done more frequently in patients with any of the following high risk groups.
4.  patients with co-morbidities like Diabetes mellitus, PLHIV, history of substance abuse, hypothyroidism, and abnormal baseline electrolytes.
5.  low BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2
6.  pre-existing anemia (Hb &lt;8 gm/dl).
7.  nutritional	deficiencies
8.  Lack of gain in appetite or weight or weight loss.
- b. To  screen  peripheral  neuropathy  for  neuromuscular  weakness  and  neurosensory  alteration  and grade, 'the DAIDS Table for grading AE &amp; peripheral neuropathy screening tool in annexure-3' is to be referred. The table 3.3 has been suggested by the national experts for screening of peripheral neuropathy which can be used at the peripheral health institution/ community level.
- c. The indicator for myelosuppression:
11.  &gt;10%	drop	in	hemoglobin	from	baseline	or	reduction	in	the	TLC	or	platelet	count	should, prompt more frequent follow ups and additional monitoring of the patients.

- x. Once a patient is declared as 'treatment failed', all attempts should be made to take opinion of state DT3C clinics	and	the	person	to	be	assessed	for	an	longer	oral	M/XDR-TB	regimen,	appropriate	modifications using replacement drug sequence (3).
- xi. Extension Criteria:
- a. The dose reduction of the Lzd to 300, because of grade 3-4 intolerance, can be considered after 09 weeks. If dose of Lzd is reduced to 300 mg the period of the BPaLM regimen will be extended upto 39 weeks
- b. In case of grade 3-4 intolerance to Mfx, drop Mfx, complete the rest of the regimen as BPaL and extend the treatment up to 39 weeks.
- c. Extension of treatment upto 39 weeks should be done with strict clinical evaluation and smear and culture microbiological follow-up at monthly interval.

## 3.3.7  Follow-up monitoring

- Once the BPaLM regimen is started, the patient will be monitored with regular clinical, bacteriological, radiological, ECG, biochemical investigations and specialist consultation if needed, as shown in table 3.4.
- Monitoring neuropathy symptoms and Hb levels may help guide Lzd dosing to avoid toxicities. A decrease in Hb level of 10% or more after four weeks of treatment initiation, may help to identify those at high risk for severe anaemia.
- All  patients initiated on BPaLM regimen need to be followed up as per the prescribed schedule. The results	of	the	above	follow-up	assessments	would	be	used	to	guide	necessary	modifications	or	change	of the regimen.

# HBsAG and other viral markers (Hepatitis A, C and E) to be done in case of jaundice

- Sociological/  psychological  evaluation  for  treatment  adherence,  reasons  for  non-adherence,  mental health status, quality of life, motivation and counselling are to be done. Referral services for care and rehabilitation will be provided if required.

## 3.3.8  Management of patients found to be ineligible for BPaLM regimen

- Patients who cannot be initiated on a BPaLM regimen will be assessed for and be managed with a 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen if eligible.
- If the patient is ineligible for both shorter regimens, then the patient will be managed with longer oral M/ XDR-TB	regimen	with	appropriate	modifications	based	on	the	decision	of	the	N/DDR-TBC	committee.
- If	a	clinical	decision	support	is	still	needed,	the	state/national	difficult	to	treat	TB	clinic	(DT3C)	may	be consulted on a case-to-case basis (3).

## 3.4 9-11-month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen

- 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/R-TB regimen is to be used in eligible persons as per integrated algorithm.
- In	patients	14	years	or	above	with	MDR/RR	TB,	BPaLM	is	first	preference.
- The 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen is to be preferred over 18-20 months longer M/XDRTB regimen in adults and children with MDR/RR-TB.
- Till	Bdq	is	available	for	the	use	in	children	below	five	years,	Bdq	is	replaced	by	inj	Amikacin,	and	other modifications	as	per	the	PMDT	guidelines	2021.
- Access to rapid DRT/ DST for ruling out FQ resistance is required before starting a patient.
- The program has adopted 9-11 month shorter oral regimen "with Lzd" for two months replacing "4 months of Eto" in IP phase, the rest of the medicine and duration of treatment remains same as earlier.

## 3.4.1  Eligibility criteria:

The eligibility criteria for the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen is mentioned below:

- i. Rifampicin resistance detected.
- ii. MDR/RR-TB with FQ resistance not detected.
- iii. No history of exposure to previous treatment with second-line medicines in the regimen (Bdq, Lfx, Cfz or Lzd	as	applicable)	for	more	than	one	month	(unless	susceptibility	to	these	medicines	is	confirmed)
- iv. No extensive TB disease
- v. No severe forms of extra-pulmonary MDR - TB like CNS TB, spinal/ skeletal TB (miliary TB or TB with multiorgan involvement or disseminated TB)
- vi. As Eto has been replaced by Lzd in the regimen therefore the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR- TB regimen with Lzd can be given to pregnant women irrespective of the gestational age with appropriate safety monitoring in consultation with the patient (3). Further, if Z resistance is detected during initial phase (IP), the patient will be switched to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen.
- vii.   For the Lzd containing regimen, thyroid function test is not required in pre-treatment evaluation. viii.  InhA mutation and/or KatG mutation:
8.  Lzd containing shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen can be given even in case of both KatG &amp; InhA mutations are present.
9.  In case of both KatG &amp; InhA mutation, Eto containing shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen cannot be given
- ix. Non-lactating women, non-pregnant women, pregnant women with &lt;20 or &lt;24 weeks gestation and who	is	willing	for	medical	termination	of	pregnancy	(as	per	latest	MTP	gazette	notification),	if	Eto	is	to	be used.

## 3.4.2  Regimen, dosage, and administration

- The regimen with Lzd or Eto would be as follows:

- Clinical  and  haematological  monitoring  are  crucial  to  detect  early  Lzd-associated  AEs,  particularly sudden	or	significant	drop	in	Hb(&gt;10%),	neutrophils	or	platelets.
- If sputum smear microscopy is positive by the end of the month 04, then FL-LPA and SL-LPA, culture &amp; DST should be offered and the IP should be extended. IP can be extended to month 05 or 06 based on smear results at the end of month 04 or 05 of treatment. This will be done for a maximum of 2 months (i.e., total duration of IP is not more than 6 months).
- If additional resistant to Z is detected in the baseline sample on C&amp;DST or FQ/InhA &amp; KatG mutation is detected in month 04 sample, the patient needs to be reassessed at N/DDR-TBC for stopping shorter oral  Bedaquiline-containing  MDR/RR-TB  regimen  and  initiation  of  longer  oral  M/XDR-TB  regimen, immediately on receiving the report

## 3.4.3  Baseline and follow-up monitoring

While	using	the	9-11	month	shorter	oral	MDR/RR-TB	regimen	with	Lzd,	the	following	modification	would	be considered in baseline and follow up monitoring:

- Ophthalmic evaluation, including visual acuity and colour vision test, need to be done at baseline and week 09, 13, 26 and more frequently if clinically indicated.
- CBC, including Hb and platelets, needs to be done at baseline followed by week 2, week 4 and week 8
- If Eto is not used, there would be no need for monitoring TSH
- Repeat NAAT for H, FQ, SLI, Eto resistance detection or FL and SL LPA (Lfx, Mfx, Am, Eto) and LC DST (Mfx 1.0, Lzd, Z, Bdq, Pa*, Dlm*) (*whenever available) if culture is positive at the end of month three or later and end of treatment or smear is positive at the end of IP, end of extended IP and end of treatment

## 3.4.4  Regimen modification

Based	on	the	recent	evidence,	the	following	regimen	modifications	are	permissible	in	the	modified	9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen with Lzd (23):

- i. Bdq is usually given for six months but can be extended to 11 months, particularly if IP is extended from four to six months due to a positive sputum smear result at month 4.
- ii. Lzd is only given for two months (instead of 4-6 months of Eto). In case of missed doses of Lzd upto 14 days, the missed doses may be added at the end of 2 months if resistance to FQ, Hh, Z has been ruled out.
- iii. To reduce the severity of AEs, Lzd dose should not be reduced to less than 600 mg.
- iv. In case of Lzd intolerance leading to permanent discontinuation of Lzd 600 mg within the initial two months period, replace Lzd with four-six months of Eto to complete the regimen, Suppose person has consumed Lzd for six weeks and develops intolerance, Eto needs to be started. The period for Eto will be 04 months minus 6 weeks, i.e period of Eto (4 months) minus the period of Lzd(6weeks) consumed at the time of replacement. Still if the regimen cannot be continued because of any reason, declare the outcome as 'treatment failed' and switch to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen without Lzd after reassessment.
- v. If,  for  any  reason,  a  patient  is  unable  to  tolerate  Z  or  E,  then  drop  one  (but  only  one)  of  these  drugs during CP and complete the treatment duration. If two or more of these drugs or any of the other drugs (Bdq, Lfx/Mfx, Lzd/Eto, or Cfz) are stopped due to intolerance or emergence of drug resistance, declare the  outcome  as  'treatment  failed'  and  switch  the  patient  to  longer  oral  M/  XDR-TB  regimen  after reassessment.(3).

## 3.5 18-20 months longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen

- (6 or longer) Bdq (18-20) Lfx Lzd Cfz Cs
- To be given to eligible person as per integrated algorithm in chapter 2.
- The patients who cannot be initiated on BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR-TB regimen due to reasons of ineligibility, additional resistance, intolerance, non-availability of any drug in use or emergence of	exclusion	criteria	will	be	managed	with	longer	oral	M/XDR-TB	regimen	modified	in	accordance	with the replacement sequence.
- After month 06 of treatment, the patient must be reviewed based on month 05 culture results. If month 05 culture result is not available at the end of month 06, decision to taper the dose of Lzd to 300 mg will be based on month 04 culture result. If the month 05 or 04 culture result (whichever applicable) remains positive, after initial 06 months, Lzd 600 mg may be extended by one month and maximum for two months based on month 06, month 07 culture reports and clinical/radiographic response. If the 8th month culture is positive, declare the outcome as treatment failed, subject the culture isolate to FL-LPA, SL-LPA and C&amp;DST. If any additional resistant to Group A, B or C drugs in use is detected, the patient needs	to	be	reassessed	at	N/DDR-TBC	for	modification	of	longer	oral	M/XDR-TB	regimen	immediately on receiving the report.

- The duration of Bedaquiline is limited to 6 months. Extension beyond 6 months is to be considered in patients in whom an effective regimen cannot otherwise be designed if only 2 of 5 drugs are available from Groups A &amp; B and adequate number of Group C drugs are not available due to high background resistance, non-availability or unreliability of DST.
- Maximum duration of treatment is not more than 20 months.
- Till	 the	 Bdq	 use	 is	 approved	 for	 use	 in	 children	 below	 five	 years	 in	 India,	 the	 existing	 guideline	 for management	of	MDR	TB	in	children	below	five	years	will	be	followed,	Bdq	is	replaced	by	Dlm)
- Repeat NAAT for H, FQ, SLI, Eto resistance detection or FL and SL LPA (Lfx, Mfx, Am, Eto) and LC-DST Bdq*, Lzd, Pa*, Dlm*, Z, Mfx 1.0 (*whenever available)  if culture is positive in sample collected at the end of month 06 or any time beyond.
- For XDR-TB patients the duration of longer oral XDR-TB regimen would be for 20 months.(3).

## 3.6 Isoniazid (H) mono/poly drug-resistant TB regimen

- Regimen - (06) LxREZ, to be given to eligible persons as per integrated algorithm in chapter 2.
- H mono/poly DR-TB regimen is of 06 or 09 months with no separate IP/CP. In exceptional situations of unavailability of loose drug R or E or Z, the use of 4 FDC (HREZ) with Lfx loose tablets may be considered as an option for starting the H mono/poly DR-TB regimen.
- It  can  be  extended  directly  to  9  months  in  certain  conditions.  In  patients  with  extensive  disease; uncontrolled comorbidity; extra- pulmonary TB; if smear at the end of month 4 is found positive and when	regimen	is	modified,	the	treatment	may	be	directly	extended	to	9	months.	There	would	be	no monthly extensions in this regimen.
- The patients not responding or failing in the H mono/poly DR-TB regimen demonstrating &amp; no additional resistance  to  R  will  be  considered  as  'probable  MDR  TB  case'  and  further  evaluated  for  treatment with the MDR-TB regimen in the preferred order of BPaLM if eligible, 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/ RR-TB	regimen	if	eligible	or	longer	oral	M/	XDR-TB	regimen	with	appropriate	modification	as	per	the programme guidelines.

## 3.7 Switching between treatment regimens

This section describes the management of patients while switching between shorter and longer regimens (23).

- Patients who are required to be shifted from BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen due to reasons of resistance, tolerability, availability, Interruptions and the	emergence	of	exclusion	criteria,	need	to	be	re-evaluated	for	necessary	modification	of	longer	oral	M/ XDR-TB regimen and initiated on a full course of longer oral M/XDR- TB regimen after discussion with state	difficult-to-treat	TB	clinic.
- Similarly, patients who are placed on a longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen based on the history of exposure to SLDs for more than one month awaiting DST results and later found to be eligible for the BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen (and in whom resistance is not detected on baseline specimen to H, i.e. both InhA and KatG or to FQ or Z, Bdq, Pa*, Dlm*) can be switched to any of these shorter  regimens,  provided  that  treatment  has  not  lasted  for  more  than  one  month.  If  patients  are

- switched in this way, the BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen is given for the full duration without any changes to its composition or duration.
- If a new episode of treatment is being started while switching over from BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen or vice versa, and if Bdq is sensitive or the patient is not exposed to Bdq for more than one month, Bdq needs to be continued in the new regimen till the treatment duration is completed.
- At	the	time	of	switching	between	regimens,	if	the	loading	dose	of	Bdq	(first	14	days)
- i. is  still  ongoing with no dose interruption, then complete the loading dose and shift to the thriceweekly doses after 14 days to complete the treatment duration.
- ii. is over, there is no need to repeat the loading dose. Start Bdq with a fresh bottle/strip with the thriceweekly	doses	along	with	the	first	dose	of	other	medicines	in	the	new	regimen	and	continue	the	thriceweekly doses to complete the treatment duration.
- In all the above situations, the remaining drugs (except a bottle of Bdq) of the regimen stopped should be returned for reconstitution, and a new box of the changed regimen should be initiated.
- In such patients with a change in regimen from BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen to longer or vice-versa in the initial months either due to delay in receiving the baseline DST results or before	any	definitive	treatment	outcome	can	be	applied,	the	outcome	the	'Treatment	regimen	changed' needs to be reported. The patient needs to be removed from the denominator of the previous regimen while assessing the treatment outcome.

## 3.8 Supply chain management of anti-TB drugs and logistics

This section describes procedures and supply chain management of second-line anti-TB drugs.

## 3.8.1  Drug procurement

NTEP will supply patient courses of drugs for the DR-TB regimens to the respective treatment initiating sites through the respective state drug store (SDS), district drug store (DDS), TB unit drug store (TUDS) along with the routine supply of rest of the drugs. The procurement and supply management (PSM) will be through the regular mechanisms of NTEP, like other FL and SLDs, and will be monitored using Ni- Kshay (https:// nikshay.in/) / Ni-Kshay Aushadhi (https://nikshayaushadhi.in/) online portals.

## 3.8.2  Supply chain management

- The	drugs	of	the	DR-TB	regimens	will	be	supplied	to	the	SDSs,	DDSs	and	subsequently	to	identified treatment initiating sites (DR-TB centres) through NTEP as a part of regular drug supply.

## 3.8.2.1. BPaLM regimen

- Pa 200 mg tablet is packaged in either white, round, high-density polyethylene bottles with polypropylene child-resistant	closure	or	child-resistant	blister	packages	consisting	of	a	polyvinyl	chloride	film	with	foil and paper backing.
- The tablets dispensed outside the container should be stored in a tight, light-resistant container with an expiry date that should not exceed three months. It will have a shelf-life of 24 months and will need to be stored at 25 ºC (15-30 ºC).
- BPaLM regimen will be issued as a complete box containing 26 weeks course. One Bdq bottle contains 24 weeks course of 100 mg x 188 tablets plus 12 loose tablets or Bdq 100 mg is available in strips 10 tablets in a single strip, thus leading to a need of 20 strips to complete the 26 weeks course, One Pa bottle contains 200 mg x 26 tablets &amp; Lzd is available in 600 mg X 10 tablets per strip, and Mfx is available in 400 mg X 10 tablets per strip.

- Since there are no weight bands, the patient-wise boxes (PwB) with 26 weeks' complete duration of the drugs in the regimen will be prepared by the SDS and issued to the DDS as per the stocking norms and subsequently	to	identified	treatment	initiating	sites	(DR-TB	centres)	on	a	caseload	basis.	The	composition of a PwB for the entire BPaLM course of 26 weeks is given in table 3.10, and for its extension of 27-39 weeks (13 weeks) is given in table 3.11.
- PwB	has	a	Bdq	pouch	with	12	tablets	(which	needs	to	be	taken	for	the	first	3	days	of	loading	doses)	and	a Bdq bottle with 188 tablets. The batch number and expiry date are to be mentioned on the pouch.
- Pyridoxine (Pdx) will be administered for the entire duration of treatment.
- The complete PwBs will be stored at the DDS and issued  as per the monthly case load basis to the N/ DDR TBC respectively. At the time of treatment initiation, the N/DDR TBC will open a fresh complete PwB	to	initiate	the	treatment	with	using	Bdq	loose	drugs	available	from	the	zip-lock	pouch	for	the	first three days (12 loose tablets) and the rest of the drugs directly from the PwBs.
- If	the	treatment	is	initiated	on	an	out-patient	basis,	the	first	dose	of	all	medicines	will	be	given	under observation at the N/DDR TBC, and the rest of the PwB will be provided to the treatment supporter or the patient. The patient is counselled to take 2nd and 3rd day dose from the pouch (pouch has 12 tablets for 3 days). Further treatment supporter and the patient will be directed to utilize remaining Bdq doses from the  Bdq bottle provided in the PwB from day four onwards to continue the Bdq daily loading dose upto day 14 and shift to thrice-weekly dose from day 15 till the end of 26 weeks.
- Pa (200 mg), Lzd (600 mg) and Mfx (400 mg) are to be taken as one tablet per day for the entire duration of treatment.
- After treatment initiation, respective DTO to be informed by the N/DDR-TBC and sr. DR-TB TB-HIV supervisor/ STS is responsible for handing over treatment box from the patient/relative to the trained treatment supporter.
- If the N/DDR-TBC directs to reduce the dose of Lzd 300 mg once daily dose, half a tablet of 600 mg will be consumed by the patient, and the remaining half to be discarded.
- In case of an extension of treatment beyond 26 weeks, an additional PwB to cover the drug requirement from 27-39 weeks (13 weeks) will be issued from the DDS based on the decision conveyed by N/DDRTBC. These additional drug requirements will be covered using loose drugs supplied from SDS to DDS and may be adjusted against the drugs returned from the patients who died, LTFU or whose regimens were changed.
- The patient should be encouraged to submit empty bottles to the health facility and eventually store them at DDS. If required, a new bottle of Bdq or Pa may be opened for reconstitution.

- In case the patient has been continued BPaL regimen, all Mfx (400 mg) tablets will be removed by the SDS/DDS before issuing the PwB or by the respective treatment supporter/supervisor from the ongoing PwB during an immediate home visit and the patient as well as treatment supporter informed about the change in the daily dosing. The remaining Mfx (400 mg) tablets will be returned to the concerned DDS/ SDS	for	reconstitution.	The	change	should	be	reflected	in	the	dispensation	module	of	Ni-Kshay	by	the	N/ DDR-TBC or concerned treatment supervisor as per advice of the N/DDR-TBC.

## 3.8.2.2 9 -11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen

- The constitution of the IP box of the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen will be the same as detailed in respective section (3), except replacement of four months of Eto with two months of Lzd in the IP, as applicable. Thus, 63 tablets of Lzd (600 mg) to cover the initial nine weeks are to be added to the initial monthly PwBs in place of the entire quantity of Eto(3).
- A child-friendly formulation of Bdq (20 mg scored uncoated dispersible tablet [DT]) is approved by DCGI for children and adults. Indirect bioequivalence testing of Bdq 20 mg DT child friendly and Bdq 100 mg adult formulations showed that both tablets have the same bioavailability and can be used interchangeably at the same total dose. Findings from the Bdq crush study also showed that the bioavailability of Bdq tablets suspended in water was the same as for tablets swallowed whole (28)(29).
- If	any	regimen	modification	is	advised	by	N/DDR-TBC	in	accordance	with	section	3.4.4.,	the	patient	as well as treatment supporter/supervisor must be informed about the change in the daily dosing while the	next	month's	PwB	will	be	modified	and	issued	by	the	respective	DDS/SDS	for	the	respective	patient. The remaining drugs will be returned to the concerned DDS/SDS for reconstitution by the treatment supporter/supervisor.	The	change	should	be	reflected	in	the	dispensation	module	of	Ni-Kshay	by	the	N/ DDR-TBC or concerned treatment supervisor as per the advice of the N/DDR-TBC.

## 3.8.2.3 Longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen

- Patients  who  cannot  be  initiated  on  BPaLM  or  9-11  month  shorter  oral  MDR-TB  regimen  due  to any	 reasons	 will	 be	 managed	 with	 longer	 oral	 M/XDR-TB	 regimen	 modified	 in	 accordance	 with	 the replacement sequence.
- PwBs	of	the	longer	oral	M/XDR-TB	regimen	with	appropriate	modifications	will	be	prepared	and	issued by DDS to the concerned N/DDR TBC (3).
- Delamanid 25mg DT was approved by DCGI for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults, adolescents, children, and infants with a body weight of at least 10 kg when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (30). However, adult Dlm tablets can be split, crushed or dissolved to ease administration in children without potentially altering bioavailability (28)(31).

- All the drugs in the PwB issued to be consumed by the patient as per the dosing schedule of the respective regimen till  the  end  of  treatment.  The  patient  should  be  advised  to  visit  the  N/DDR-TBC  for  end  of treatment evaluation and further actions including updating the treatment outcome on Ni-Kshay.
- If MERM boxes are being used, the empty box and the device need to be returned to the concerned DDS/ SDS for resetting and reissuing the box to a new patient.

## 3.9 Management of special situations

This chapter deals with the management of patients eligible for BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/ RR-TB regimen and longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen in special populations.

## 3.9.1  Pregnancy and lactation

- Pregnancy is not a contraindication for the treatment of drug-resistant TB but poses a great risk to both the mother and foetus.
- SLIs are contraindicated throughout the pregnancy due to their effect on the 8th cranial nerve of the foetus.	Eto	is	contraindicated	during	the	first	32	weeks	of	pregnancy	due	to	teratogenic	effects.
- There is an experience of using Lzd during pregnancy. For pregnant and lactating women, it is therefore recommended to use the regimen with Lzd instead of Eto in the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen.
- The use of Bdq in pregnancy has been shown to be associated with infants born with a lower mean birth weight  when  compared  with  infants  whose  mothers  did  not  take  Bdq;  however,  when  infants  were followed	 up	 over	 time,	 no	 other	 significant	 differences	 in	 infant	 outcomes,	 pregnancy	 outcomes	 or maternal treatment outcomes, including weight gain in infants until one year of age were observed (32).
- Pa is not recommended during the lactating period unless the mother is willing to replace breastfeeding with formula feed. Thus, the recommendation of the BPaLM regimen doesn't apply to pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is prudent to solicit the opinion of an obstetrician while treating such patients.
- All  women of childbearing age who are awaiting results of C&amp;DST as well as those receiving DR-TB treatment, should be advised, and counselled intensively to use birth control measures because of the potential risk to both mother and foetus. It should be remembered that oral contraceptives might have decreased	efficacy	due	to	vomiting	and	drug	interactions	with	DR-TB	drugs.
- All women of childbearing age should be tested for pregnancy as part of the PTE and whilst on treatment. DR-TB  patients  found  to  be  pregnant  prior  to  treatment  initiation  or  whilst  on  treatment  must  be evaluated	in	consultation	with	an	obstetrician,	considering	factors	such	as	risks	and	benefits	of	DR-TB treatment; severity of DR-TB; gestational age, and potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant women, strict counselling needs to be done for MTP, especially regarding the risk of delaying treatment, potential effects of new drugs on the foetus, including foetal abnormalities (if MTP is not opted) and the need for more intense maternal-foetal-neonatal follow-up. Appropriate counselling and an informed decision-making process for consent need to be undertaken in each case with electronic data management in Ni-Kshay, including aDSM.
- Pregnant women with MDR-TB should be jointly managed by an obstetrician and a pulmonologist or physician at DR-TBC. Management of DR-TB patients who are pregnant prior to initiation of treatment or whilst on treatment is based on the duration of pregnancy and regimen being considered as follows:
1. BPaLM regimen may be considered if the pregnant women with &lt;20 or &lt;24 weeks gestation and who is willing	for	medical	termination	of	pregnancy	(as	per	latest	MTP	gazette	notification)
2. As Lzd is an option in place of Eto, all pregnant women would be eligible for the 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen after considering other eligibility criteria. Eto based regimen may be considered after 32 weeks' gestation, if Lzd based regimen can't be used.

3. If  the pregnant woman is not eligible for both above regimens, the 18-20 month longer oral M/XDRTB regimen may be considered. Modify regimen if one or more drugs cannot be used due to reasons of resistance, tolerability, contraindication, availability etc.
2.  in the order of Z E PAS
3.  Eto may be considered after 32 weeks' gestation, if required
4.  Am may be considered in post-partum period only. Am can not be considered as a replacement drug in	the	final	12	months	of	treatment
- In women of reproductive age who have been initiated on BPaLM or 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/ RR-TB regimen or longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen and who become pregnant, the risk to the mother and foetus needs to be explained clearly. If the pregnancy is &lt; 24 weeks, the decision to continue the BPaLM regimen would depend upon the willingness of the patient to opt for an MTP as per MTP (amendment) act, 2021.
- Lactating mother should be encouraged for breastfeeding, if she is smear/ culture negative and not on Pa containing regimen.
- If	 she	 is	 unwilling	 for	 MTP	or	has	a	pregnancy	&gt;	24	weeks	duration,	she	needs	to	be	treated	with	or shifted from BPaLM (if already initiated), based on eligibility and in the given order of preference, to 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/ RR-TB regimen or longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen. In such patients, the risk to the mother and foetus needs to be explained clearly, and the pregnant DR-TB patients need to be monitored carefully, both in relation to the treatment and progress of the pregnancy. This approach should lead to good results since the patient should be smear/culture negative at the time of parturition, and the mother and infant do not need to be separated.

<!-- image -->

- The following additional monitoring is recommended for pregnant women managed with any MDR-TB regimens:
- i. These mothers should deliver in a tertiary care institute or at least at a place where a pediatrician is available.
- ii. CBC, including Hb, need to be monitored monthly and more frequently if clinically indicated.
- iii.   USG foetal anomalies scan at 18 weeks and USG growth scan at 32 weeks. A fetal echo is to be done only if there is an abnormality on the scan.
- iv. More frequent ECG and serum electrolytes may be considered as clinically indicated.
- v. The	option	of	2nd	trimester	MTP	can	be	considered	if	the	mother	is	fit	for	it,	based	on	a	fetal	scan	of 2nd trimester.
- vi.    Strict aDSM is to be done.
- vii.  ANC registration and obstetrician follow-up are to be done regularly.
- viii. If Eto is considered in the regimen, and if the basal TSH in PTE is deranged, then TSH must be done monthly and once it is normal (less than 2.5), then quarterly during treatment. Check the infant for early evidence of hypothyroidism.
- ix.  In case para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and Eto are given (which cause hypothyroidism)  and Lzd (which causes myelosuppression) to a newborn who has been exposed to a cocktail of drugs, certain baseline investigations at birth like CBC and TSH should be done.

## 3.9.2  Children

- Safety and effectiveness of BPaLM regimen with Pa in children &lt; 14 years have not been established. Thus, children below 14 years should be treated with 9-11 month shorter or longer oral regimens as per eligibility in consultation with the paediatrician available or linked to the N/DDR-TBC.
- Bdq has been approved by the regulatory authority for use in children 5 years and above. Bdq may be used in shorter or longer regimen in children less than 5 years of age whenever approved by the regulatory authority.

## 3.9.3  Older people

- Clinical	studies	of	the	combination	regimen	of	Pa,	Bdq,	and	Lzd	did	not	include	sufficient	numbers	of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Hence,  health  status  and  underlying  co-morbidities  must  be  assessed  carefully  before  considering patients  aged  65  years  and  over  for  BPaLM  regimen,  and  if  included,  they  would  need  much  closer monitoring.

## 3.9.4  People living with HIV

Management of DR-TB patients in people living with HIV should be done in consultation with ART centre. BPaLM regimen can be given to eligible MDR/RR-TB and Pre-XDR-TB regardless of their HIV status and CD4 count	provided	they	fulfil	all	other	eligibility	criteria.	However,	care	should	be	taken	when	CD4	counts	are below 100 cells/mm3. It is important to consider drug-drug interactions when administering TB and HIV medications in combination with respect to the following points.

- i. Efavirenz  induces  metabolism  of  Bdq,  so  its  co-administration  with  Bdq  may  result  in  reduced  Bdq exposure and loss of activity; therefore, co-administration is to be avoided. Efavirenz also reduces Pa exposures	significantly;	therefore,	an	alternative	antiretroviral	agent	(potentially	dolutegravir	(DTG), although	 there	 is	 currently	 insufficient	 evidence	 for	 this)	 should	 be	 used	 if	 the	 BPaLM	 regimen	 is considered.
- ii. Ritonavir may increase Bdq exposure, which could potentially increase the risk of Bdq-related adverse reactions; however, increased risk has not been noted in studies administering both drugs concurrently. Individuals who are prescribed both Bdq and ritonavir should be monitored closely for adverse events, including QTc prolongation.

- iii.  Zidovudine (no longer commonly used or recommended for HIV treatment in adults and adolescents) should be avoided, if possible, because both zidovudine and Lzd may cause peripheral nerve toxicity and are known to have myelosuppression cross-toxicity (23).

These cases should be managed through consultation between the ART Centre and DR-TB Centre.(3).

## 3.9.5  People with renal insufficiency

- Generally	Bdq,	Lnz	and	Mfx	are	considered	safe	in	renal	insufficiency
- Renal	insufficiency	may	be	caused	by	TB	infection	itself	or	by	previous	use	of	aminoglycosides.	Patients with	renal	insufficiency	and	initiated	on	BPaLM	or	9-11	month	shorter	oral	MDR/RR-TB	regimen	or longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen may develop severe anaemia and electrolyte imbalance.
- Patients	 with	 renal	 insufficiency	 should	 be	 carefully	 evaluated	 before	 the	 start	 of	 any	 MDR/RR-TB regimen if the PTE rules out the exclusion criteria. Owing to limited experience with the use of this regimen, caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal failure.

## 3.9.6  People with liver disorders

- In various DR-TB regimens under NTEP, R, H, Z, PAS, Eto, Bdq and Pa are potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatitis rarely occurs with the FQs.
- The  potential  for  hepatotoxicity  is  increased  in  the  elderly,  alcoholics,  malnourished  and  in  patients with pre-existing liver disease. In general, most SLDs can be safely used in the presence of mild hepatic impairment, as they are relatively less hepatotoxic than FLDs.
- For patients on BPaLM regimen, routine liver function test (LFT) is recommended at month three in all patients and then as and when clinically indicated. DR-TB patients having deranged LFT during PTE should be strictly  monitored  and  more  frequently  as  clinically  indicated  while  on  treatment.  Once  a patient on SLDs develops hepatitis, other etiologies should be excluded, such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, drug- induced hepatitis by non-TB drugs etc.
- Close	monitoring	of	liver	enzymes	is	recommended,	and	the	drugs	may	need	to	be	stopped	if	significant liver	inflammation	is	apparent.

## 3.9.7  People with diabetes mellitus

- Blood	sugar	levels	may	be	difficult	to	control	in	patients	with	MDR/RR-TB	and	diabetes,	and	insulin	may be required to gain adequate blood sugar control during treatment.
- Patients  with  diabetes  are  also  at  increased  risk  of  peripheral  neuropathies,  which  may  be  further exacerbated following exposure to Lzd and Hh. These patients must be counselled to report symptoms of peripheral neuropathies early because such symptoms may necessitate a change in regimen - either to the Eto-containing 9-11 month shorter oral MDR/RR-TB regimen (bearing in mind this will still include Hh in the IP), or longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen without Lzd.
- The concomitant use of metformin at high doses and Lzd may increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Also, the long-term use of Lzd, Hh and cycloserine (Cs) in patients with diabetes can lead to an increased risk of peripheral neuritis. Baseline optic neuropathy or retinopathy or maculopathy may worsen after Lzd use; hence, eye evaluation is recommended before and during treatment. Regarding potential baseline renal damage in diabetics, Am or Sm should be used with caution. Patients with DR-TB and diabetes may need close	follow-up	and	support,	with	quick	identification	of	drug-drug	interactions	and	adverse	events	(23).

## 3.9.8  People with anaemia

- Patients with TB commonly have anemia of chronic disease. Many patients with TB also suffer with nutritional	 deficiencies,	 and	 low	 Hb	 may	 also	 be	 a	 result	 of	 iron	 deficiency	 and	 low	 iron	 stores.	 This deficiency	may	resolve	naturally	once	effective	TB	treatment	(even	including	Lzd)	leads	to	resolution	of TB symptoms and improvement in the patient's anaemia, diet and appetite.
- Extended	use	(≥	2	weeks)	of	Lzd	has	been	associated	with	reversible	myelosuppression	and	requires intensive monitoring.
-  Therefore, the Lzd-containing regimen must not be offered to patients with a pretreatment serum Hb below 8 g/dL that cannot be rapidly corrected (i.e. with blood transfusions) before starting MDR/RR- TB treatment.
-  Some patients respond well to an initial blood transfusion that raises their Hb above 8 gm/ dL and allows them to at least start a Lzd-containing regimen. Lzd will not necessarily cause myelosuppression in patients with baseline anaemia.
-  Although blood transfusions may help to reverse anaemia following withdrawal of Lzd, they may not resolve Lzd-induced myelosuppression with ongoing exposure to the drug. Therefore, if Lzd toxicity	leads	to	a	drop	in	Hb	below	8	g/dL	during	the	first	two	months	of	treatment,	Lzd	should	be withdrawn, and the regimen switched appropriately.
-  More research is needed on the role of iron supplementation to treat anaemia during MDR/RR- TB treatment; however, oral supplementation of iron is often not well tolerated and is not immediately effective at the start of treatment, at a time when the pill burden can be overwhelming and the risk of multiple drug side- effects is high (23).
- Similarly, owing to the morbidity associated with severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, the Lzdcontaining	regimen	is	not	suitable	in	patients	with	neutrophils	below	0.75	×	109/L	(or	750/mm3)	or platelets	below	150	×	109/L	(or	1,50,000/mm3)	before	starting	treatment.	Some	patients	respond	well to an initial blood transfusion that raises their Hb above 8 gm/ dL and allows them to at least start a Lzdcontaining regimen. Lzd will not necessarily cause myelosuppression in patients with baseline anaemia, although a baseline Hb below 10.5 g/dL has been reported as a risk factor for Lzd-induced anaemia.
- If	Lzd	toxicity	leads	to	a	drop	in	Hb	below	8	g/dL	during	the	first	two	months	of	treatment,	Lzd	should	be withdrawn, blood transfusions may help to reverse anaemia. The Lzd reintroduction may be tried after Hb is above 9 g/dL. More research is needed on the role of iron supplementation to treat anaemia during MDR/RR- TB treatment; however, oral supplementation of iron is often not well tolerated and is not immediately effective at the start of treatment, at a time when the pill burden can be overwhelming and the risk of multiple drug side- effects is high (23).

## 3.10 Adverse events

- Identification	 of	 adverse	 drug	 reactions	 (ADR)	 should	 be	 a	 part	 of	 patient	 interaction	 at	 the	 time	 of treatment initiation  as  well  as  treatment  supporters  should  be  involved  in  sensitization  sessions  for common ADR. N/DDR- TBC initiating the treatment should be informed immediately once any ADR is reported	by	the	patient	in	the	field.
- If	the	treatment	is	stopped	in	the	field	due	to	any	reason,	the	N/DDR-TBC	should	be	informed	immediately to take the necessary action to reintroduce the treatment, modify or replace the regimen and/or manage the ADR.
- The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Pa in combination with Bdq and Lzd are peripheral neuropathy, hematological abnormalities, visual impairment and cardiotoxicities.
- Other adverse reactions included acne, nausea, vomiting, headache, increased transaminases, dyspepsia, rash, pruritus, abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, lower respiratory tract infection, hyperamylasemia, hemoptysis, back pain, cough, hypoglycemia, abnormal loss of weight, and diarrhoea (33).

- New data on the safety of Pa based on hormone evaluations in four clinical trials and a paternity survey were  also  assessed;  these  data  have  largely  alleviated  previous  concerns  on  reproductive  toxicities observed  in  animal  studies,  suggesting  that  adverse  effects  on  human  male  fertility  are  unlikely.    A study assessing semen in men undergoing treatment that includes Pa is in progress and will address any remaining concerns (9)(12).
- Management of patients experiencing QT prolongation and hepatotoxicity during MDR-TB treatment with newer regimens is detailed in annexure 2 &amp; 3.
- Pyridoxine (Pdx) will be administered for the entire duration of treatment as per weight band (3).
- Pyridoxine  supplementation  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  neuropathy  in  patients, supporting its inclusion in treatment protocols to mitigate drug-induced neuropathy.
- Pyridoxine to be used in the BPaLM regimen to provide added protection against neuropathy.

## 3.11 Management of treatment interruptions and lost to follow-up

- Interruption and missed doses in BPaLM regimen has been detailed in a separate section 3.3.6.
- All  efforts  must  be  made  to  ensure  that  the  DR-TB  patients  do  not  interrupt  treatment  or  are  not LTFU. Action should be taken to promptly retrieve patients who fail to come for their daily dose by the treatment supporter/ supervisor.
- All possible efforts should be made to support the patient and manage the adverse events to ensure uninterrupted  treatment  and  intake  of  all  medicines  in  the  regimen;  however,  when  severe  toxicity occurs, the medicine should be stopped.

## 3.11.1 Patients who miss doses

All missed doses during IP (wherever applicable) must be completed prior to switching the patient to CP. Similarly, all missed doses during CP must be administered prior to ending treatment.

## 3.11.2 Patients who interrupt treatment for less than 9 weeks

When  the  patient  returns  to  resume  treatment,  the  treatment  will  be  continued,  and  the  duration  of treatment will be extended to complete the regimen. The follow-up smear or cultures will be done as per the schedule.

- a. Consecutive treatment interruption (of all medicines in the regimen) of up to two weeks needs to be made up and added to the treatment duration.
- b. Non-consecutive missed doses of all medicines in the regimen up to a cumulated total of four weeks need to be made up and added to the treatment duration.
- c. In case of tolerances is exceeded for anyone of the above two conditions, general guidance is to consider clinical review, declare outcome as treatment failed if the interruption is due to ADRs or lost to follow up and switch to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen.

An additional culture may be considered if the DR-TB patient returns between four to nine weeks of treatment and has clinically deteriorated. If the culture is positive, repeat FL/SL LPA and LC DST need to be done as per  the  integrated  algorithm.  If  additional  resistance  is  detected  to  any  component  drugs,  the  outcome will be declared as 'treatment failed', the patient will be sent to NDR-TB centre for clinical, radiological and microbiological review and be switched to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen with a fresh PTE.

## 3.11.3 Patients who interrupt treatment continuously for 9 weeks or more and return for treatment

- Such patients will be given an outcome of LTFU. The patient would be revaluated as per the integrated algorithm to restart with appropriate treatment. (This is not applicable to BPaLM)
- If there are signs of impending treatment failure for any MDR/RR-TB patient with or without additional resistance to SLDs, the patient should be switched to longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen and evaluated further to modify appropriately based on DST results if required.

## 3.11.4 For patients who interrupt Bdq during the first two weeks of the Bdq course and return to resume the treatment

- If the interruption is up to seven days, Bdq will be continued to complete the doses, and the duration of treatment	will	be	extended	to	complete	first	two	weeks	of	loading	dose	and	the	compensation	to	be	done before starting Bdq 200mg thrice weekly. Follow-up cultures will be done as per the revised schedule, and
- If the interruption is more than seven consecutive days, the Bdq course will be reloaded (started afresh with a new bottle and the old bottle sent for reconstitution after adjusting for the additional tablets required for reloading). And a fresh specimen collected for culture and the culture isolate must be stored for Bdq DST in the future. Follow-up cultures will be done as per the revised schedule.

## 3.11.5 Patients who interrupt Bdq during 3-26 weeks of the Bdq course and return to resume treatment

During the maintenance phase of Bdq dosing, Bdq can be reinitiated with the loading dose if the interruption, if any, is up to nine weeks. If Bdq is interrupted for

- i. less than two consecutive weeks, no reloading is required. Resume the thrice-weekly dosing schedule and complete the treatment duration.
- ii. more than two weeks (but less than eight weeks), Bdq should be reloaded at the higher daily dose of 400 mg for seven days before resuming the thrice-weekly dosing schedule.
- iii. more than eight consecutive weeks, then declare the outcome as 'LTFU' and the patient and treatment plan should be reassessed to consider longer oral M/XDR-TB regimen (23). (This is not applicable to BPaLM)

## PATIENT SUPPORT DURING DRUG-SUSCEPTIBLE AND DRUG-RESISTANT TB 4

The CHO, HF and TU staff will be responsible for screening all contacts of the patient for TB (either symptom screening  and/or  chest  X-ray)  and,  if  eligibility  to  provide  TPT,  ensuring  treatment  support,  adherence monitoring, regular follow-up assessments, identifying and referring patients experiencing adverse events for	aDSM,	Ni-Kshay	entries,	declarations	of	final	treatment	outcome.	The	final	treatment	outcome	of	DR-TB patients will be given in consultation (preferably teleconsultation) with a HF doctor or the concerned N/ DDR- TBC if the patient is unable to visit the facility for any reasons. All patients should be subjected to longterm follow-ups at months 6, 12, 18 and 24.

## 4.1 Ambulatory care

After treatment initiation, while referring the patient back to the HWC or HF of the public or private sector for ambulatory treatment, patients should be referred after updating all relevant information in Ni-Kshay for TB.

In the case of MDR-TB patients, the patient should be referred with the remaining PwB initiated at N/ DDRTBC for the entire duration of treatment and a copy of the PMDT treatment book and referral form under intimation	of	the	district	TB	officer	(DTO).	The	respective	DTO	or	MO-TU	or	HF	doctor	or	CHO	or	private health care provider should be informed by the concerned staff of N/DDR-TBC on the referral of patients for ambulatory care in advance by means of the NTEP PMDT referral for treatment process via Ni-Kshay, email or	mobile	phone.	Confirmation	that	the	patient	has	reported	to	the	concerned	HF	doctor	or	CHO	or	private health- care provider from the respective N/DDR-TBC must be received by N/DDR-TBC including acceptance by the current HF of the district as soon as the patient reaches home and is initiated on ambulatory care with a patient turnaround time (TAT) of within one week of referring the patient.

## 4.2 Counselling

Health education and counselling to the patients and their family members about the disease, the mechanism of transmission and the necessity of taking regular and adequate treatment is of utmost importance. Effective counselling for all patients and their family members from the time of treatment initiation with DS-TB is found to be effective in preventing the development of drug resistance. In all circumstances, counselling should start at the initial point of contact as soon as the diagnosis is established and continued during all visits by the patient to a health facility as well as by the healthcare workers to the patient's home or through the national TB call centre (Nikshay Sampark). The trained counsellors at the NDR-TBC would be responsible to ensure regular counselling of all DR-TB patients under care of the respective N/DDR-TBC as well as coordinate with the supervisors to retrieve patients who interrupt treatment and extend them all necessary care and support they need till the end of treatment.

## 4.3 TB aarogya saathi mobile app

All patients and their care takers should be encouraged to use the TB aarogya saathi mobile app (https://play. google.com/store/search?q=tb+aarogya+sathi+app&amp;c=apps&amp;hl=en) linked to their Ni-Kshay patient ID to keep track of information pertaining to their care, including treatment adherence monitoring and enablers. Digital  adherence  technology,  including  reporting  on  TB  aarogya  saathi  mobile  app,  will  be  deployed  to ensure adherence monitoring with signals to Ni-Kshay to document daily treatment adherence rate and prioritized home visits to treatment interrupters for prompt retrieval.

## 4.4 Nutritional assessment and support

Nutritional assessment is important to be done during PTE and at every follow-up visit. Holistic nutrition assessment,	 nutrition-specific	 counselling,	 nutrition	 support	 by	 linkages	 and	 nutrition	 supplementation should be offered. This can also be self-assessed by the patients and caretakers using TB aarogya saathi mobile app.

Patients with severe malnutrition (HB &lt;7 g/dl, BMI &lt;16 kg/m2 with pedal oedema, MUAC &lt; 16 cm) need to  be  hospitalized,  if  required,  for  appropriate  management.  Patients  with  severe  or  moderate  acute malnutrition (SAM or MAM) may need to be appropriately managed to provide adequate nutritional support with reference to the Guidance Document for Nutritional care and support to TB patients in India 2017 (34).

The	significant	burden	of	TB	in	India	is	compounded	by	the	dual	existence	of	food	insecurity	and	undernutrition, signifying the necessity of facilitating nutritional support to TB patients. Under the Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY), all patients are eligible for Rs 1000 per month as nutritional support for the entire duration of their TB or DR-TB treatment. All patient data must be entered into Ni-Kshay on a real-time basis. The patients and providers	would	be	eligible	for	Direct	Benefit	Transfer	(DBT)	and	enablers	as	applicable.

## 4.5 Community support to TB patients under 'Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyan'

It becomes imperative to strengthen collaboration with the community and the existing institutions in society that	can	play	a	critical	role	in	filling	gaps	and	addressing	social	determinants.	CTD	has	initiated	this	with the objective of providing additional patient support to improve treatment outcomes, augment community involvement in meeting India's commitment to end TB by 2025 and leverage the avenues for corporate social responsibility towards ending TB. Under this initiative, the programme is facilitating a mechanism to enable the elected representatives, non-governmental organizations, individuals, institutions (both public and private), corporates and partners to support efforts to end TB as Ni-Kshay Mitra. The support to TB patients is envisaged through the adoption of blocks or urban wards or districts or even individual or groups of patients for effecting a better response against TB to complement government efforts. In this regard, all active TB patients need to give consent to be part of this programme and DTOs will link them to avail this the support from Ni-Kshay Mitra through Ni-Kshay.

The	 progress	 of	 the	 patient	 on	 treatment	 would	 be	 monitored	 using	 interim	 as	 well	 as	 final	 treatment outcomes,	 which	 are	 detailed	 below.	 The	 following	 definitions	 are	 the	 most	 recent	 outcome	 definitions recently revised by WHO and would apply to all forms of TB patients (3).

## 5.1 Interim outcomes

## 5.1.1  Bacteriological conversion

After	bacteriological	confirmation	of	TB,	at	least	two	consecutive	cultures	(applicable	for	DR-TB	and	DS-TB) or smears (applicable for DS-TB only) taken on different occasions at least seven days apart are found to be negative.

## 5.1.2  Bacteriological reversion

At least two consecutive cultures (applicable for DR-TB and DS-  TB)  or  smears  (applicable  for  DS-TB only) taken on different occasions at least seven days apart are found to be positive either after the initial conversion	or	for	patients	without	bacteriological	confirmation	of	TB.

For	defining	treatment	failed,	bacteriological	reversion	is	considered	only	when	it	occurs	in	the	continuation phase.

Time-to-culture conversion is calculated as the interval between the date of treatment initiation and the date	of	the	first	of	these	two	negative	consecutive	smears	or	cultures	taken	seven	days	apart	(date	of	sputum specimens collected for culture should be used).

## 5.2 Final Outcomes

## 5.2.1  Treatment failed

A  patient  whose  treatment  regimen  needs  to  be  terminated  or  changed  permanently  to  a  new  regimen option or treatment strategy. The reason for the changing the regimen permanently include:

- a) No clinical response and/ or no radiological response
- b) No bacteriological response (no bacteriological conversion achieved or bacteriological reversion after initial conversion; bacteriological reversion is considered only when it occurs in the continuation phase)
3.  For BPaLM regimen: 'bacteriological reversion' would be considered only during the period between 26-39 weeks in cases where treatment duration has been extended to 39 weeks. It will not be considered in BPaLM regimen of treatment duration of 26 weeks).

- c) ADRs,
- d) Evidence of additional drug resistance to medicines in the regimen.

## Failure outcome definitions for BPaLM: Failure will include

- i. The culture of sample collected at month 04 or later is positive for M.TB.
- ii. Amplification	of	resistance	to	B,	Pa	and	or	L
- iii.   No clinical response

## 5.2.2  Cured

A	pulmonary	TB	patient	with	bacteriologically	confirmed	TB	at	the	beginning	of	treatment	who	completed treatment as recommended by the national policy with evidence of bacteriological response 1  and no evidence of treatment failed.

## 5.2.3  Treatment completed

A patient who completed treatment as recommended by the national policy whose outcome does not  meet the	definition	of	cure	or	treatment	failed.

## 5.2.4  Died

A patient who died 2   before starting or during the course of treatment.

## 5.2.5  Lost to follow-up

A patient who did not start treatment or whose treatment was consecutively interrupted for one month  or more. (not applicable to BPaLM)

## 5.2.6  Not evaluated

A patient for whom no treatment outcome was assigned 3

## 5.2.7  Treatment regimen changed:

The patients who has been initiated on treatment, in case of baseline resistance to the drugs in the regimen (when available) is found, the treatment need to be changed to an appropriate regimen and the outcome to be given as 'treatment regimen changed'. The patient needs to be moved out of the denominator of the previous regimen. The outcome of only the changed regimen needs to be reported. The same would be applicable for patients who switched between the DS-TB and the DR-TB regimens.

## Treatment regimen changed outcome definitions for BPaLM:  Treatment regimen changed will include:

- i. Discontinuation of B, Pa or Lzd because of intolerance, toxicity at any point of time
- ii. Baseline DST resistance to B/Pa/L when available

The treatment regimen changed because of intolerance and baseline DST resistance are to be recorded in Ni-kshay and analyzed separately.

## 5.2.8  Sustained treatment success

An individual assessed at six months (for DR-TB and DS-TB) and at 12 months, 18 months and 24 months (for DR-TB only) after successful TB treatment who is alive and free of TB (36).

## 5.3. Long term follow-up

Patients who completed TB treatment remain at risk of TB recurrence (re-infection or relapse). TB patients require regular follow-up starting from the treatment initiation until two years after successful treatment completion to achieve the desired outcome of recurrence-free survival. Hence, the programme introduced patient assessment at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of treatment (35).

1 Bacteriological response - bacteriological conversion with no reversion.

2 Patients died for any reason

3 This includes cases 'transferred out' to another treatment unit whose treatment outcome is unknown and excludes LTFU.

## 6.1 Recording and reporting in Ni-Kshay under NTEP

The entire cascade of patient care from diagnosis through treatment outcome as well as post-treatment follow-up needs to be updated in Ni-Kshay in appropriate modules and meticulously. In this vein, sequential data entry points made need to be noted solemnly. The suggestive ones are as noted below:

- Enrolment	is	needed	before	generating	any	test	request,	and	the	first	point	of	contact	of	the	patient	is expected to do the enrolment via the available mechanisms like CHO or patient provider support agency (PPSA) if applicable.
- Test requests may need to be generated by the health facility requesting the test.
- Test details may need to be updated by the testing facility.
- Treatment initiation need to be updated by the initiating the treatment.
- Treatment	outcomes	need	to	be	updated	by	the	where	the	patient	has	completed	the	treatment	and	final assessment(s).(3).
-  PTE module will be made available in Ni-Kshay in due course of time.
-  Adverse drug reaction monitoring is currently available in Ni-Kshay as per the questionnaire per the pharmaco-vigilance programme of India (PvPI) format, which will be made more nuanced in the coming days.
-  Albeit newer treatment regimens are anticipated to be made available in the regimen selection section in Ni-Kshay, the greater emphasis is expected to be on further utilization of the dispensation module, which would enable any treatment changes within a given instance of the disease.
-  Transfer of patients, when needed, would be effected via the transfer module of Ni-Kshay.
-  Reports	and	case-based	data	would	accordingly	be	updated	for	the	information	on	newer regimens as well for monitoring purposes.

The  aDSM  data  extracted  from  Ni-Kshay  will  be  analyzed  at  CTD  with  support  from  WHO  India.  The relevant information will be shared with the sub-group of NTEG on a monthly basis as a routine for drug safety monitoring. The data on action required on an immediate basis will be shared with the sub-group of NTEG by CTD.

The  sub-committee  of  NTEG  would  evaluate  periodically  (quarterly  and  more  frequently  if  required) accumulated  data  for  patient  safety,  progress  and  continuation  and  make  a  recommendation  to  CTD concerning	further	refinement	of	the	guidelines.

Physical copies of any records or document(s), like treatment card(s), and register(s) if required, may be printed from Ni-Kshay, in inevitable circumstances only.

Detailed  training  materials  on  various  modules  of  Ni-Kshay  can  be  accessed  from  the  following  link: https://nikshay.zendesk.com/hc/en-us

## 6.2 Programme monitoring

## Annexure 1:

## Chronology of events for the introduction of pretomanid-containing regimen in India

Post approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2019, a series of high-level consultations	between	TB	Alliance,	M/s	Viatris	(erstwhile	M/s	Mylan),	officials	from	the	Ministry	of	Health and	 Family	 Welfare,	 DCGI,	 officials	 from	 NTEP,	 Indian	 Council	 for	 Medical	 Research	 (ICMR)	 and	 WHO Country	Office	for	India	on	fast-tracking	regulatory	approval	and	modalities	of	the	introduction	of	BPaLM regimen in India.

In  January  2020,  the  Subject  Expert  Committee  of  the  Central  Drugs  Standard  Control  Organization (CDSCO) approved Pa to be used only as conditional access under the NTEP. The committee noted that there is	an	unmet	need	for	the	drug	in	a	patient	with	XDR-TB	(erstwhile	definition).	The	use	of	Pa	in	combination with Bdq and Lzd is reported to be advantageous in respect of the reduction of the duration of treatment from 20 months to six months. However, the drug should be used under the restricted conditions to prevent its misuse and development of resistance etc. In July 2020, DCGI issued permission to manufacture the drug.

In  September 2020, based on WHO recommendations and a series of deliberations on concerns of high toxicity with 1200mg of Lzd in the regimen, NTEG recommended that a BPaL research proposal may be considered	with	the	flexibility	to	adapt	to	anticipated	results	of	ZeNix	trial	with	four	arms	of	reduced	dosage and duration of Lzd in BPaL; and in exceptional cases, BPaL can be considered as a last resort by NTEP under prevailing ethical standards in individual patients for whom the design of an effective regimen is not possible as per WHO recommendations.

NIRT, Chennai, in collaboration with CTD and WHO India, developed a multicentric study protocol that was converted into a pragmatic three arm clinical trial to 'evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of various doses of Lzd in combination with Bdq and Pa in adults with Pre-XDR, or MDRTI/NR (treatment intolerant/ non-responsive) pulmonary TB in India' based on recommendations from experts in National Operational Research Committee (NORC). In June 2021, M/s Viatris agreed to donate 400 courses of Pa (200mg	tablet)	to	Central	TB	Division	for	the	modified	BPaL	(mBPaL)	regimen.	The	study	is	funded	by	USAID through the UNION. In October 2021, the enrolment of eligible patients commenced and was expected to be completed in 2022. The study is expected to be completed with post-treatment 12 months follow-up of all enrolled patients by the end of 2024. The results have been described in the respective section above (16).

In  2022,  based  on  WHO  recommendation,  the  NTEG  recommended  CTD  to  prepare  a  protocol  with  a guidance document on the proposed technical recommendation of utilizing BPaLM for the treatment of MDR-TB as per the indications and implement to gain local experience and generate evidence in selected geographies	across	India	with	regular	safety	and	efficacy	monitoring	by	CTD	to	guide	NTEP	on	the	further expansion.

In August 2024, the ICMR completed the health technology assessment and submitted a report to NTEP, MoHFW recommending  BPaLM  as  a  cost-effective  and  cost-saving  strategy.  The  NTEG  recommended introduction of BPaLM under programmatic setting.

## Annexure 2:

## Standard operative procedure for collection, transportation and processing of extra-pulmonary specimens

## Introduction

Extra pulmonary specimens are divided in two groups based on the site and mode of collection and extent of contamination.

- Aseptically	 collected	 specimens,	 usually	 free	 from	 other	 microorganisms	 (sterile)	 -	 fluids	 like	 spinal, pleural,	pericardial,	synovial,	ascitic,	blood,	bone	marrow,	tissues	(lymph	node,	tissue	biopsies)	and	fine needle aspirates (FNAs).
- Specimens	contaminated	by	normal	flora	or	specimens	not	collected	aseptically	(not	sterile)	-	gastric lavage, bronchial washings, urine, pus and stool (in case of disseminated TB in HIV infected patients and infants).

## Collection of extra-pulmonary specimens

Body	fluids	(spinal,	pleural,	pericardial,	synovial,	ascitic,	bone-marrow)	should	be	aseptically	collected	in	a sterile container by the physician using aspiration techniques or surgical procedures. Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible.

## i. Pleural fluid

Considered	a	suboptimal	specimen	as	tubercle	bacilli	are	mainly	in	the	pleural	wall	and	not	within	the	fluid. The	minimum	volume	for	pleural	fluid	required	for	processing	for	culture	is	20-50ml.	The	fluid	is	collected using pleural tap or thoracocentesis.

## ii. Pericardial fluid

Should be collected using ultra sonogram.

## iii. Blood

Blood as a specimen for isolating M. tuberculosis should be generally discouraged for the low diagnostic yield and high possibility of contamination with respect to the technique required for its culture.

## iv. Tissues

The	aseptically	collected	tissues	are	placed	by	the	physician	in	sterile	containers	preferably	without	fixatives or preservatives. If the specimen is to be shipped, it should be protected from drying by adding sterile saline maintaining  a  temperature  of  4-15oC.  Specimens  should  be  transported  to  the  laboratory  as  quickly  as possible.

## v. Swabs

Swabs are always sub-optimal specimens and not recommended because of risk of infection for specimen collector. They may be useful in children and patients who cannot produce sputum or may swallow it. A sterile absorbent cotton swab should be used for collection. The best time for the collection is early morning before food and drinks are taken. The swab should be placed in a screw capped container containing normal (0.9%) saline to prevent drying. Swabs except for laryngeal swabs or from discharging sinus should be avoided.

## vi. Urine

Among  specimens  expected  to  be  contaminated,  urine  is  the  most  common.  To  minimize  excessive contamination  of  urine  specimens,  special  instructions  for  collecting  urine  with  adequate  cleansing  of external genitalia to prevent contamination by commensals should be given. Early morning sample should be  collected  in  500  ml  screw  capped  sterile  containers.  Once  received  in  the  laboratory,  urine  must  be immediately processed or centrifuged and the pellet refrigerated for further processing. As excretion of tubercle bacilli in urine is intermittent, it is advised to collect three early morning specimens on different days.

## vii. Bronchial secretions

Other respiratory specimens that can be submitted to the laboratory for mycobacteria culture are bronchial secretions (minimum volume: 2- 5ml) and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) (minimum volume of 20 - 50 ml). Trans-bronchial and other biopsies should be collected under sterile conditions and placed in 0.5-1.0 ml of sterile normal (0.9%) saline to prevent drying during transportation to the laboratory.

## viii. Gastric lavage

In children, who rarely produce sputum, the aspiration of the early morning (gastric content) may be used for TB diagnosis. This is done as an in-patient procedure. This should be transported immediately to the lab and processed (not more than 4 hours) to prevent the killing action of the acid content in the gastric lavage on the tubercle bacilli. In the event of delay, the sample can be neutralized using 1-2 ml of sterile 10% sodium bicarbonate solution depending on the volume of gastric aspirate. If facilities are available for aseptic neutralization, it may be carried out at the periphery. Else, specimens are to be sent to the C&amp;DST laboratory without addition of any reagent along with an indication that the specimen has not been neutralized. The laboratory would perform neutralization prior to processing.

## Note:

- Samples for culture should never be collected in formalin;
- If histopathological examination is required, two samples should be collected. No preservative should if being sent for TB culture; and
- Necessary instructions are to be given to the concerned staff for sending the biopsy specimen in normal saline for culture and not in formalin.

## Transportation of extra pulmonary specimens

As for pulmonary specimens, extra pulmonary specimens will need to be transported in cool boxes (below 200 o C)  to  be  compatible  for  liquid  culture  systems  as  well  as  molecular  methods.  Triple  packing  system should be used for transportation. All precautions that are followed for transporting pulmonary specimens should be followed for EP specimens too.

When sending out specimens or when receiving them, check that:

- Test request form is placed separately in a self-sealing pouch;
- Containers are labelled not on the cap but on the wall of the container; and
- Date of dispatch and particulars of the health centre are on the accompanying list.

## i. Specimens and request forms

All  specimens  transported  to  the  laboratory  must  be  accompanied  by  the  request  form.  Tests  must  be performed only upon written request of authorized persons and oral requests without follow up written instructions  should  not  be  allowed.  It  is  also  important  that  specimen  request  forms  are  kept  separate

from the specimens themselves. Forms that have been contaminated by specimens should be sterilized by autoclaving.	If	mistakes	in	filling	request	forms	and	labelling	of	specimens	are	found,	reject	specimens	and mention the reasons for rejection in the register. Document the time of specimen receipt in the laboratory and note any delays in delivery in the remarks column of the register.

## Registration of samples

## i. Receipt of incoming specimens

For safety reasons, specimens should be received in the registration area of the laboratory.

To minimize risk of infection, the following procedures should be applied:

- The specimen box received should be opened only in a biosafety cabinet inside the laboratory. (Do not open on an open bench at the lab reception).
- Before opening the package, inspect the delivery box for signs of breakage or leakage; if there is gross leakage evident, discard the package following biomedical waste management.
- If on gross inspection there is no leakage, proceed for sample opening.
- Open the package carefully and re-check for any leakage. In case of leakage, discard the entire contents following biosafe precautions. Rejection/ leakage of samples, to be informed to the respective DTOs immediately to enable re-collection of specimen.
- Check labelling of specimens in the specimen container and test request form.
- Register the samples in LIMS and proceed for processing by the appropriate method.
- Document the date of the receipt of the specimen, patients name, age, sex and address, the name of the referring health centre, the reason for testing and volume of the specimen in the C&amp;DST lab register.

## ii. Decontamination of extra-pulmonary samples

Most  of  the  extra-pulmonary  specimens  are  paucibacillary  in  nature.  Hence,  they  require  milder decontamination.

## Processing of EP specimens for MGIT960

Isolation	of	M.	tuberculosis	by	MGIT	system	requires	the	final	inoculum	to	be	in	an	ideal	condition	that	will not	interfere	with	the	fluorescence.

## Pus and other muco-purulent specimens

- Thick	pus	of	volume	&gt;10	ml	is	decontaminated	using	the	NALC	-	NaOH	method	as	sputum.
- If the volume is &lt; 10 ml, either aliquot and process only 10 ml by NALC-NaOH method or concentrate the initial volume by centrifugation for 15-20 minutes and re-suspend the pellet in 5 ml of sterile distilled water. If the pus is too thick, add about 50-100 mg of NALC powder; mix well and decontaminate using NaOH.	Re-suspend	the	final	pellet	in	buffer	to	reduce	the	Ph.
- If the pus is not thick, decontaminate using 2-4% NaOH. The concentration of NaOH can be changed based on the expected level of contamination in the specimen which depends on the site of collection.

## Gastric aspirates

- Distribute the volume in smaller aliquots and centrifuge the tubes at 3000 x g.
- Pool the deposits, add 5ml distilled water and decontaminate it using NALC-NaOH or 2-4% NaOH.

## Bronchial washings

- Process using NaLC-NaOH like sputum.
- If	the	specimen	is	&gt;10	ml	in	volume,	process	the	whole	specimen.
- If &lt;10ml, concentrate the specimen by centrifugation (3000x g, 15-20 minutes).
- Add 5 ml sterile water to the pellet and decontaminate as for sputum.

## Laryngeal Laryngeal swabs

- Transfer the swab into a sterile centrifuge tube and add 2 ml sterile water.
- Add 2 ml of NaLC-NaOH solution and mix well in a vortex mixer.
- Let it stand for 15 minutes. Remove the swab with forceps, squeezing the liquid out of the swab and discarding it.
- Fill the tube with phosphate buffer and mix.
- Centrifuge at 3000xg for 15-20 minutes.
- Discard	the	supernatant	fluid	and	re-suspend	the	sediment	in	1-2	ml	sterile	buffer.	Use	this	suspension for smear and culture.

## Tissue

- Homogenize the tissue in a tissue grinder with a small quantity of sterile saline or water (2-4 ml).
- Decontaminate the homogenized specimen using NaLC-NaOH procedure as in sputum.
- Re-suspend the sediment with phosphate buffer.
- If the tissue grinder is not available, use a mortar and pestle.
- Tissue may also be placed in a petri dish with sterile water (2-4 ml) and be torn apart with the help of two sterile needles.

## Urine

- Isolation of mycobacteria from urine specimens using MGIT has not been validated.
- Aliquot the entire volume in several centrifuge tubes.
- Concentrate the specimen by centrifugation for at least 20-25 minutes
- Re-suspend the pellet in each tube with 1-2 ml of sterile water and pool together.
- Decontaminate using 4% NaOH as for sputum.

## Other body fluids (CSF, synovial fluid and pleural fluid)

As	these	fluids	are	collected	usually	under	aseptic	conditions,	they	require	only	milder	decontamination.

- If the specimen volume is more than 10 ml, concentrate by centrifugation at about 3000x g for 15-20 minutes.
- Liquefy thick or mucoid specimens prior to centrifugation by adding NALC powder (50- 100 mg).
- Re-suspend the sediment in about 5 ml of saline.
- Mix and decontaminate as for sputum.

## Blood

- Isolation of mycobacteria from blood specimens by MGIT 960 has not been evaluated thoroughly. A few published studies have used blood after lysis centrifugation. Ideally BACTEC Myco/F Lytic medium is recommended for isolation of mycobacteria from blood samples.

## Annexure 3:

## Perception of Vibration

- Press the ends of a 128 Hz tuning fork together so the sides touch and let go. Place the vibrating tuning fork on the bony prominence on the patient's wrist to be sure that they can recognize the vibration or 'buzzing' quality of the tuning fork.
- Again, press the ends of the tuning fork hard enough so that the sides touch and let go. Immediately place	the	vibrating	tuning	fork	gently	but	firmly	on	the	top	of	the	distal	interphalangeal	(DIP)	joint	of the great toe and begin counting the seconds. Instruct the Subject to tell you when they stop feeling the vibration or 'buzzing'. Repeat for the great toe on the other foot.

## Vibration Perception Grade Scale:

- 0-	Vibration	felt	for	&gt;	10	seconds	(normal)	1-	Vibration	felt	for	6-10	seconds	(mild	loss)
- 2- Vibration felt for 5 seconds or less (moderate loss)
- 3- No feeling of vibration (severe loss) 9 - Unable to evaluate or did not assess

## Medical treatment of Peripheral neuropathy

- Usually occurs later in treatment, while hematological abnormalities occur earlier in treatment
- Non-steroidal	anti-inflammatory	drugs	or	acetaminophen	may	help	alleviate	symptoms
- Pregabalin (75 mg) + methylcobalamine (750 mg) twice a day also used (take care of giddiness/sleepiness). Pregabalin dose upto 150-300 mg twice daily
- Gabapentin has been helpful for many individuals. Adults should be treated initially with a single dose of 300 mg on Day 1, increased to 300 mg twice a day on Day 2, and 300 mg 3 times a day on Day 3.
- Tab Gabapentin NT (a combination of Gabapentin 100 mg and Nortriptyline 10 mg) once daily, to be taken in the evening. May be increased upto Gabapentin/Nortriptyline (Tab Gabapentin NT 300 mg/10 mg)
- Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (start with 25 mg at bedtime, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 150 mg) can be tried (to be avoided with Bdq as mild MAO inhibitor: may cause Serotonin syndrome).
- Duloxetine:
-  Initiate Cap Duloxetine 20 mg twice daily (BD) for 30 days, followed by once daily (OD) for the next 30 days.
-  If	no	relief	is	seen	with	the	BD	dose	within	the	first	15	days,	increase	the	dose	to	20	mg	three	times daily (TDS).
- Avoid Duloxetine with Linezolid as it may cause Serotonin syndrome
- Refer to Nodal DR-TB center and to specialist for further management (may delay the treatment)

## Annexure 4:

## Management of patients experiencing QT prolongation and hepatotoxicity during MDR-TB treatment

## QT Prolongation

## Suspected agent(s): Mfx, Dlm, Pa, Bdq, Cfz Suggested management strategies:

- QT interval is measured from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave on a standard
- ECG. The QT is corrected for heart rate, which is referred to as the QTc and is calculated by most ECG machines. Values above QTc Fridericia correction (QTcF) 450 ms in males and 470 ms in females are referred to as prolonged. Patients with prolonged QTcF are at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias like torsade's de pointes, which can be life-threatening. Bdq, FQ, Cfz, Pa and Dlm may cause prolongation of the QTcF. Among FQs, Mfx cause the greatest QTcF prolongation, while Lfx has a lower risk. Currently, ECG monitoring prior to initiation and during DR-TB treatment is only required with the use of Bdq or when two drugs known to prolong QTcF (e.g. Mfx, Cfz, Pa, Dlm) are combined in the same regimen.
- Low serum levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium are associated with QTc prolongation. Electrolyte levels should be maintained in the normal range in any patient with an elevated QT interval. Also, avoid other  drugs  that  increase  the  QT  interval.  The  patient's  renal  and  hepatic  function  should  also  be monitored.
- QT prolongation can result in ventricular arrhythmias (Torsade's de Pointes) and sudden death. It is, therefore,  imperative  that  ECGs  be  used  to  monitor  the  QT  interval  regularly  during  the  use  of  the suspected drugs.
- Management of increased QTcF entails looking at the algorithm for the reintroduction of anti-TB drugs (Mfx,	Dlm,	Pa,	Bdq,	Cfz)	once	prolonged	QTc	has	normalized	as	shown	in	table	and	figure	below:

## Hepatotoxicity

## Suspected agent(s): Z, H, R, Eto, PAS, Bdq, Pa

Hepatotoxic drugs in the shorter/ longer MDR/RR-TB regimen are Z, H, R, Eto, PAS, Bdq, Pa. Hepatitis occurs rarely with the FQ. The potential for hepatotoxicity is increased in the elderly, alcoholics, malnourished and in patients with pre-existing liver disease. In general, most second-line drugs can be safely used in the presence of	mild	hepatic	impairment,	as	they	are	relatively	less	hepatotoxic	than	first-line	drugs.

Once a patient on second-line anti-TB drugs develops hepatitis, other etiologies should be excluded such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, drug induced hepatitis by non-TB drugs etc. Further management should be on the same line as in non-DR-TB patients. MDR/RR- TB patients having deranged liver function test (LFT) during pretreatment evaluation should be strictly monitored as clinically indicated while on treatment.

## Suggested management strategies:

- In  cases  where  the  patient  is  very  sick,  i.e.,  meningitis,  sputum  smear  grade  3+,  administer  ATT,  e.g. Amikacin, FQ and Cs. Where the patient is not seriously ill, and one can wait, the introduction of ATT can be done once enzyme levels are near within 2 times of normal;
- If	enzymes	are	more	than	five	times	the	upper	limit	of	normal,	stop	all	hepatotoxic	drugs	and	continue with at least three non-hepatotoxic medications (for example, the injectable agent, FQ and Cs). If hepatitis worsens or does not resolve with the three-drug regimen, then stop all drugs;
- eliminate other potential causes of hepatitis (viral hepatitis and alcohol-induced hepatitis being the 2 most	common	causes)	and	treat	any	that	are	identified;	and
- once enzyme level improves, reintroduce remaining drugs, one at a time, with the least hepatotoxic agents	first,	while	monitoring	liver	function	by	testing	enzymes	every	three	days.	If	the	most	likely	agent is not essential, consider not reintroducing it.

## Points to note

- history of previous drug hepatitis should be carefully analyzed to determine the most likely causative agent(s); these drugs should be avoided in future regimens;
- viral serology should be done to rule out other etiologies of hepatitis if available, especially to hepatitis A, B and C;
- alcohol use should be investigated, and alcoholism addressed; and
- Generally, hepatitis due to medications resolves upon discontinuation of the suspected drug.

## Management of hepatotoxicity during treatment with DR-TB regimen is described figure below:
