You may still be able to get a Sure Start Maternity Grant if you already have children under 16 years old.

Yes Tell us about them.

You cannot usually get a grant unless your new baby is:

-  the only child under 16 in your family
-  your dependant's new baby is the only baby under 16 in your family, or
-  you care for a child in your household who is not your own. Please clearly tell us about your relationship, including if you are a Kinship carer, for any other child under 16 living with you.

By 'Kinship carer' we mean someone who becomes responsible for a child who cannot be looked after by their biological parents.

You will not be a Kinship carer if the child living with you is your partner's biological child.

For more information about Kinship carers, go to www.kinship.org.uk Step children or partner's children under 16 are counted as children living with you so if you have stepchildren or partner's children under 16 years of age living with you, then you may not be able to get  a Sure Start Maternity Grant.
