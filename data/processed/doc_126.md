## Pregnancy Reference Card

(You can complete this at your first appointment.)

Planning for a healthy pregnancy means understanding your health risks, how they can affect your pregnancy, and ways to reduce or address them.

Healthcare providers will use a range of information to create a healthy pregnancy plan that is just right for you. This can include your body mass index (BMI), health history, current health, medicines and supplements you take, lifestyle, and other factors.

Use this card as a starting point for you and your provider to create a healthy pregnancy plan that meets your health needs.

## BMI: Be More Informed

Check out these resources about health, nutrition, and physical activity during pregnancy. They may help you come up with questions to ask your provider.
