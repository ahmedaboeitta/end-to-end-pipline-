## Foreword

The Federal Hypertension Control Leadership Council convened in 2020 in response to the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension to make equitable hypertension control a national priority. Controlling hypertension can save lives, improve health and resilience, and reduce costs. The Council's 12 founding federal agencies and offices work together to inspire, coordinate, and accelerate action to improve hypertension prevention, detection, and control for all.

This is a daunting charge. Hypertension in the United States is common, often uncontrolled, and harmful. Nearly 120 million people, 1 in every 2 U.S. adults, have hypertension, and only 1 in 4 of those adults has it under control. Disparities in both prevalence and control abound. Black adults experience earlier onset of high blood pressure, adding years of harm from elevated pressure. American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black adults and individuals living in rural areas have rates of control below the national average. In everyone, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, heart failure, dementia, and complications of pregnancy.

Hypertension-before, during, and following pregnancy-is on the rise in the United States. Hypertension in pregnancy not only jeopardizes the lives and health of both mothers and babies but raises their lifetime risk of heart disease and stroke, the first and fifth causes of death in the United States, respectively. Improving the timely detection and management of hypertension in pregnancy is an investment in health and prosperity for families, communities, and workplaces across the nation.

For these reasons and more that you will read on the following pages, members of the Federal Hypertension Control Leadership Council are proud to support the Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package and its widespread implementation by clinicians, teams, and health systems across the country. This collection of effective, evidence-informed approaches can help accelerate the adoption of what works to prevent harm from hypertension in pregnancy. Thank you for joining us on this mission.

## Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package-Quick Reference

The Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package is a guide to help outpatient clinical settings put systems in place to improve the care they provide for women with hypertension in pregnancy. It provides resources tailored for outpatient care of pregnant women and women of reproductive age, including strategies related to

- Identification of chronic hypertension in women of reproductive age and early pregnancy
- Early diagnosis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia
- Prevention of preeclampsia with aspirin prophylaxis in patients at higher risk

## Focus Areas

<!-- image -->

- Prescription of antihypertensive treatment when indicated
- Rapid escalation of care for severe hypertension in pregnancy
-  Postpartum counseling on warning symptoms, long-term cardiovascular risk, prevention strategies, and reproductive life planning and contraception
- Establishing effective transitions of care to support lifelong cardiovascular risk counseling and management

## What Is the Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package?

The Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package (HPCP) is a guide to help outpatient clinical settings put systems in place to improve the care they provide for women with hypertension in pregnancy.

The HPCP presents an evidence-informed listing of process improvements with accompanying tools and resources that outpatient clinicians and care team members can implement as they provide care to pregnant women and women of reproductive age with a focus on early identification, optimal management, and prevention of complications of hypertension in pregnancy. The HPCP is composed of change concepts, change ideas , and evidence- or practice-based tools and resources .

- Change concepts are general notions that are useful in the development of more specific ideas for changes that lead to improvement.
- Change ideas are specific, actionable ideas for changing a process. Change ideas can be rapidly tested on a small scale to determine whether they result in improvements in the local environment.
-  Evidence- or practice-informed tools and resources listed with each change idea can be adapted or adopted in a clinical setting to improve identification and management of hypertension in pregnancy.

There is strong evidence that a systematic approach to chronic hypertension management in the general population can significantly improve hypertension-related care processes and outcomes. 1 The science behind cardiovascular risk reduction related to hypertension in pregnancy is evolving. Although there is a need for definitive data in the pregnant and postpartum population, some evidence-based methods that have demonstrated success in the context of chronic hypertension in the general population may confer benefit.

Furthermore, pregnancy is a period of physiologic hemodynamic stress that offers a unique opportunity to identify future cardiovascular risk at a time when risk reduction earlier in the lifespan can have a great impact. 2-3

Effective management of hypertension in pregnancy necessitates collaboration among multidisciplinary care teams across both inpatient and outpatient settings. The management of severe hypertension in pregnancy in emergency and inpatient settings is addressed by several comprehensive toolkits from professional societies and organizations and state perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs), several of which are listed in Appendix A. However, the HPCP provides resources tailored for outpatient care of pregnant women and women of reproductive age, including strategies related to

- Identification of chronic hypertension in women of reproductive age and early pregnancy
- Early diagnosis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia
- Prevention of preeclampsia with aspirin prophylaxis in patients at higher risk
- Prescription of antihypertensive treatment when indicated
- Rapid escalation of care for severe hypertension in pregnancy

-  Postpartum counseling on warning symptoms, long-term cardiovascular risk, prevention strategies, and reproductive life planning and contraception
- Establishing effective transitions of care to support lifelong cardiovascular risk counseling and management

## Hypertension in Pregnancy and Its Associated Risks

All forms of hypertension in pregnancy are associated with an increased incidence of maternal and neonatal complications, as well as long-term cardiovascular risk factor and disease development. 4-8 Hypertension in pregnancy encompasses chronic (or preexisting) hypertension and pregnancy-associated hypertension, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia or eclampsia. The impacts of pregnancy associated hypertension extend beyond pregnancy and the postpartum period. Research has increasingly shed light on its impact on future health, including associations with earlier onset of sustained chronic hypertension and increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. 4, 9-10

The classification of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) variably includes chronic hypertension depending on the guidelines and definitions set forth by professional medical societies. Recognizing the substantial impact that all forms of hypertension may have on maternal and fetal/offspring outcomes both in pregnancy and long term, this document uses the term hypertension in pregnancy to include both chronic hypertension and pregnancy-associated hypertension (i.e., gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and preeclampsia/ eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension) .

While various guidelines differ on blood pressure (BP) treatment thresholds and targets, currently, there is a general consensus for the definition of hypertension in pregnancy as two or more blood pressure readings during pregnancy of ≥140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic measured 4 hours apart. Severe hypertension in pregnancy is defined as BP of ≥160 mmHg systolic and/or ≥110 mmHg diastolic measured at least 4 hours apart, though the diagnosis may be confirmed within minutes for treatment purposes. BPs in the severe range that are persistent on measurements at least 15 minutes apart are considered a hypertensive emergency and warrant urgent therapy ( Figure 1 ). 11-12

## Burden of Hypertension in Pregnancy on Morbidity and Mortality

The prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy has been rising in recent years, in part due to increased prevalence of risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and advanced maternal age. 13 Up to 1 in 5 women of reproductive age are affected by chronic hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg), with hypertension in pregnancy affecting 15.9% of delivery hospitalizations. 13,14

All forms of hypertension in pregnancy are associated with an increased incidence of maternal and neonatal complications, as well as long-term cardiovascular risk factor and disease development.

*A diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy may be made when either the systolic or diastolic threshold is met or exceeded.

Chronic Hypertension: Hypertension that is preexisting, is diagnosed in the first 20 weeks of gestation, or persists beyond 12 weeks postpartum.

## Pregnancy-Associated Hypertension

Gestational Hypertension: Hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation with previously normal blood pressure.

## Preeclampsia without severe features:

Hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation and previously normal blood pressure with proteinuria :

-  ≥300 mg per 24 hour urine collection
-  Protein/Cr ratio ≥0.3
-  Dipstick reading of 2+ (when other methods unavailable)

## Preeclampsia with severe features (at least one of the following):

-  BP ≥160/110* mmHg on two readings
-  New-onset cerebral or visual disturbance (e.g., new persistent headache, visual changes not due to other causes)
-  Pulmonary edema
-  Hepatic dysfunction (transaminases &gt;2 times upper limit of normal) or severe persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication
-  Renal insufficiency (Cr &gt;1.1 mg/dL or doubling of serum Cr in absence of other renal disease)
-  Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000 per microliter)

Eclampsia: Preeclampsia with new-onset seizures without other cause.

## Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes and Pregnancy-Related Mortality

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as placental abruption, preterm delivery, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction, and perinatal death, as well as other serious maternal complications, which may occur during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiomyopathy, seizures, and death. 4, 16-19

Hypertension in pregnancy is among the leading causes of pregnancy-related mortality, defined as a death while pregnant or within 1 year of the end of pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy. From 2017 to 2019, hypertension in pregnancy caused 6.3% of pregnancy-related deaths. 20 Data from state maternal mortality review committees (MMRCs) indicate that more than 53% of pregnancy-related deaths occurred 1 week to 1 year following the end of pregnancy, 21 highlighting the importance of incorporating strategies for risk counseling and continued monitoring of women with conditions that arise during pregnancy, including hypertension in pregnancy, to continue after 6 weeks postpartum. 22

Importantly, most of these deaths are considered preventable. MMRCs determine the preventability of pregnancy-related deaths based on data available during case review. Analysis of pregnancy-related mortality in California demonstrated that 100% of deaths attributed to preeclampsia/eclampsia were determined to have at least some chance of being prevented, and 60% had a good-to-strong chance of being prevented. 23 Furthermore, an analysis of data from four states found that clinician factors, such as missed or delayed diagnosis and the use of ineffective treatments, were identified in nearly two-thirds of preeclampsia- and eclampsia-related deaths. 24 Implementing strategies to enhance early recognition and appropriate management of hypertension in pregnancy may have an impact on these preventable deaths.

## Disparities and Health Inequities in Hypertension in Pregnancy

Non-Hispanic Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women experience the highest prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy; approximately 1 in 5 Black women and 1 in 6 American Indian/ Alaska Native women have hypertension at delivery hospitalization. 13 Hypertension in pregnancy contributed to a higher proportion of pregnancy-related deaths among Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women compared with White women. 25 In addition to disparities related to race and ethnicity, prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy is also higher for women at least 35 years of age and for women living in the South and Midwest, in rural counties, and in areas with the lowest median household income. 13

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes ... as well as other complications, which may occur during pregnancy or in the postpartum period.

Stratifying clinical data by race, ethnicity, sex, age, insurance status, preferred language, transportation, and other SDOH is an important step to identify care gaps that may contribute to health disparities. Those involved in the care of pregnant and postpartum women can play a key role in achieving health equity in pregnancyrelated outcomes by assessing and addressing disparities in hypertension management.

## Long-Term Risks for Pregnant Women and Their Children

In addition to serious complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period, hypertension in pregnancy is associated with increased cardiovascular risk later in life for both pregnant women and their children. Pregnancyassociated hypertension, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, is associated with earlier onset of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, as well as increased risk of cardiovascular disease including heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. 26-27 Hypertension in pregnancy is associated with cardiovascular mortality, with a pronounced 1.7- to 3.6-fold increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with preeclampsia. 28 Recognition of the association of preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes with future cardiovascular risk has led to their inclusion in guidelines as riskenhancing factors in cardiovascular disease risk assessment. 28

Hypertension in pregnancy may also pose long-term risks for the children of affected pregnancies. In utero exposure to hypertension in pregnancy is associated with future risk of hypertension. 30 Studies have also suggested increased risk of stroke and all-cause mortality, particularly in children of pregnancies complicated by early-onset preeclampsia and preeclampsia with severe features. 31-33

## Quality Improvement Opportunities: Improving Prevention, Identification, and Management of Hypertension in Pregnancy

Targeting prevention, identification, or management of hypertension in pregnancy provides good starting points for quality improvement (QI) initiatives on practiceor system-wide levels.

## Prevention

Low-dose aspirin (81 mg) for certain pregnant women at higher risk of preeclampsia started between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation, optimally before 16 weeks, and continued daily until delivery has been shown to reduce risk of preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality and is supported by guidelines. 34-35 Indications for aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy are detailed in Figure 2 . Developing a system to identify pregnant women who can benefit from aspirin prophylaxis and promote adherence can be targets for QI initiatives to reduce preeclampsia and related complications.

## Identification

Approximately 1 in 5 women of reproductive age have chronic hypertension, many of whom may not be aware of the diagnosis. 14, 36 Wellwoman visits are an opportunity to address hypertension in this population. 37 Furthermore, prepregnancy counseling is recommended to provide crucial insights into potential health risks and optimize conditions for a healthy pregnancy. 38-39 If counseling prior to pregnancy is not feasible, pregnancy is a time when women may have better access to and present more regularly for health care and is a valuable opportunity to identify chronic hypertension, perform baseline evaluation, and establish a treatment plan. Early diagnosis of hypertension before or during pregnancy allows for initiation

of lifestyle changes and therapies to reduce the likelihood of complications and depends on timely screening via BP measurement. Studies have shown that in general patient populations, there are nontrivial numbers of patients with multiple elevated BP readings who do not have a diagnosis of hypertension. 40-45 These patients with potentially undiagnosed hypertension have been deemed 'hiding in plain sight' and are less likely to be on antihypertensive therapy than their counterparts with a diagnosis. 41, 46 Though there are fewer published studies assessing potentially undiagnosed hypertension in pregnancy, large health systems have identified it as a QI opportunity. 47

measuring BP , proper technique is essential to obtain accurate readings ( Figure 3 ). It is important to use a BP device that has been validated for accuracy in pregnancy (see Appendix B). 49-50

Hypertension identified prior to 20 weeks' gestation is consistent with chronic hypertension, hypertension identified after 20 weeks' gestation may be due to gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Baseline evaluation for these conditions includes 11-12, 51

- Serum labs including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, and transaminase levels
-  Complete blood count

Guidelines recommend screening for hypertension in pregnancy using BP measurements throughout pregnancy at each prenatal visit due to the substantial net benefit and minimal risk of harm. 48 When

- Spot urine protein/creatinine ratio or creatinine clearance calculated from 24-hour urine total protein and creatinine
-  Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, when indicated, such as for symptomatic patients

Among those with chronic hypertension, 20-50% of pregnancies progress to superimposed preeclampsia, and half of those with gestational hypertension will develop preeclampsia . 11-12 Thus, for these women, monitoring of BP , symptoms, and laboratory markers, such as urine protein, throughout pregnancy is essential. Implementing algorithms and checklists for monitoring intervals and indicated laboratory studies can help ensure appropriate management. BP monitoring may be achieved through frequent antenatal visits; however, incorporating self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring for women with elevated BP can be a helpful strategy that engages patients in their care. SMBP is discussed in Appendix B.

## Antepartum Management of Hypertension in Pregnancy

Identification of hypertension during pregnancy, as in the general population, should prompt counseling on lifestyle, including recommendations on healthy dietary patterns, physical activity, and recommended weight gain during pregnancy. Antihypertensive medication may be indicated to lower BP and reduce the risk of complications. Pregnant women with hypertension should be counseled on warning signs of preeclampsia and hypertensive emergencies and given clear instructions on when and how to seek medical attention. It's also important that all patientfacing staff, including those who answer phone lines, schedule appointments, and perform patient intake and vital sign measurement, are trained in recognizing symptoms and BP elevations that require prompt escalation of care. Clinicians who care for pregnant and postpartum women should not hesitate to make timely and appropriate referrals to maternal-fetal medicine specialists, internal medical specialists, or cardiologists or a higher level of care facility when indicated.

Use 140/90 mmHg, rather than the previous 160/105-110 mmHg, as either a threshold to initiate treatment or as the upper-limit target BP for chronic hypertension.

For acute-onset severe hypertension, urgent therapy with antihypertensive agents is warranted, and magnesium sulfate may be indicated for seizure prophylaxis. Depending on the gestational age, coexisting maternal conditions, and fetal status, delivery or expectant management with pharmacotherapy may be appropriate. 12 Recognition of severe BP elevation in the outpatient setting is critical and should prompt urgent referral to a higher level of care for management. In outpatient care settings, clear protocols should be in place for escalating care, including arranging transportation.

Management of less severe BP elevation in pregnancy differs by the underlying diagnosis. For gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features, antihypertensive agents are not currently recommended for BP &lt;160/110 mmHg, though evidence for efficacy and safety of a lower treatment threshold is evolving. Guidance for chronic hypertension, on the other hand, was recently updated after results from the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) trial were published. This multicenter randomized controlled trial found that women randomized to antihypertensive therapy to achieve a stricter BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg experienced better pregnancy outcomes. 52 These findings informed clinical guidance updates, with recommendations to use 140/90 mmHg, rather than the previous 160/105-110 mmHg, as either a threshold to initiate treatment or as the upperlimit target BP for chronic hypertension. 53-54

When prescribing antihypertensives in pregnancy, consideration must be given to their safety in pregnancy and lactation. Preferred medications are listed in Table 1 . Additionally, careful attention should be paid to the potential need for dose adjustments due to changes in metabolism of particular drugs during pregnancy. For women taking medications to manage preexisting chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy, it is advisable to substitute medications with known adverse effects in pregnancy with preferred alternatives.

## Postpartum Management of Hypertension

In the postpartum period, elevated BP may persist after a diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy or may occur without any preceding hypertension. Most pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. More than 50% occur &gt;7 days to 1 year after the end of pregnancy, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause . 21 Thus, it is important for both patients and care providers to recognize and respond to warning signs and severely elevated BP. All pregnant and postpartum patients, particularly those with a history of hypertension in pregnancy, should receive counseling on warning signs for preeclampsia and instructions on when and how to seek medical care. Additionally, SMBP may play a role in the postpartum monitoring of BP for women with a diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. 56

Recommendations for postpartum follow-up of women with hypertension in pregnancy vary, but a pragmatic approach includes SMBP until a visit within 7-10 days after delivery or within 72 hours for those with severe hypertension. 15 Following this initial contact, it is recommended that ongoing care be provided as indicated including a comprehensive postpartum visit within 12 weeks of birth. 22

The postpartum visit is an excellent opportunity to ensure BP control, assess social drivers of health, and provide counseling on

- Lifestyle factors such as healthy dietary pattern, sodium intake, physical activity recommendations, and smoking cessation
-  Pregnancy planning and contraceptive choices, with consideration of risks of estrogencontaining hormonal contraception use in women with hypertension and increased risk for adverse health events as a result of pregnancy
- Lifelong cardiovascular risk and need for establishing primary care for regular follow-up and cardiovascular risk factor screening and management
- Warning signs for serious acute cardiovascular events and how and when to seek medical care

While BP may normalize in the postpartum period in women with pregnancy-associated hypertension, limited data suggest 40-50% of women with pregnancy-associated hypertension have persistently elevated blood pressures at 6 weeks postpartum, and approximately 40% of women with severe preeclampsia have hypertension 1 year postpartum . 57-60 Persistent hypertension beyond the postpartum period warrants consideration of a diagnosis of chronic hypertension. Lifestyle counseling and pharmacotherapy to achieve BP goals should occur as in the general population to reduce long-term cardiovascular risk. Consideration should also be given to potential secondary causes of hypertension, particularly in women less than 30 years of age, those requiring multiple antihypertensive agents, and those with low-serum potassium so that appropriate targeted therapies may be provided. Refer to the Million Hearts® Hypertension Control Change Package for tools and resources on strategies for hypertension control in the general population.

## Lifelong Cardiovascular Risk: Counseling and Care Transitions

It is essential that a clinician is identified for ongoing preventive care and cardiovascular risk management for women with hypertension in pregnancy. In general, rates of follow-up for continuity of care are low, resulting in a missed opportunity for cardiovascular risk reduction. 61 Many women may not have an established primary care clinician. Establishing processes to identify a clinician responsible for continuity

of care after pregnancy is crucial, and women should be counseled on the importance of receiving this follow-up care. A clear plan for follow-up, including warm handoffs whenever possible, should be arranged at the postpartum visit with a process for providing women with pertinent aspects of their pregnancy history, such as a patient summary or medical records, to be shared with their primary care clinician and subspecialists for long-term follow-up and cardiovascular risk surveillance and management.

## How Can I Use the Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package (HPCP)?

The HPCP is meant to serve as a menu of options from which practices can select specific interventions to improve diagnosis and management of hypertension in pregnancy. We do not recommend that any practice attempt to implement all of the interventions at once, nor is it likely that all interventions will be applicable to your clinical setting.

Start by bringing together a team of clinicians, administrators, and other interested parties to discuss the aspects of hypertension in pregnancy that are most in need of improvement (see Appendix C for additional quality improvement resources that can be useful in planning improvement activities, like a root cause analysis). The team can then select corresponding interventions from the HPCP that best address those issues.

Figure 4 provides the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model for Improvement. 62 The model suggests posing three questions:

1.  What are we trying to accomplish?
2.  How will we know that a change is an improvement?
3.  What changes can we make that will result in improvement?

Figure 4. Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model for Improvement 62

Figure 5. Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package Focus Areas

<!-- image -->

The answers to these questions will help identify specific quality improvement objectives and related metrics, and you can choose corresponding change ideas from the HPCP that align with your objectives. Each strategy you choose should first be tested on a small scale (i.e., with 'small tests of change') to assess feasibility and allow the team to evaluate and adjust before instituting the change on a broader, more permanent scale. This approach can be accomplished using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles .

The HPCP is broken down into four focus areas: key foundations, equipping care teams, population health management, and individual patient supports ( Figure 5 ).

Tables 2-5 contain a list of change concepts and change ideas relevant to hypertension in pregnancy that clinicians and practices have successfully implemented to improve hypertension management. Each change idea is paired with several tools and resources suggested by experts in the field who have successfully used them. See the acknowledgements and contributors page for content contributors.

- Key Foundations (Table 2) offers ways to establish practice foundations for effective hypertension in pregnancy management efforts and is likely the best place to focus initial quality improvement efforts. This includes identifying a champion to provide leadership on focused quality improvement efforts and making hypertension in pregnancy management a practice priority.
- Equipping Care Teams (Table 3) lists strategies related to training and preparing clinicians and other care team members to focus on hypertension in pregnancy management. Strategies include supporting patient medication adherence and other forms of self-management.
- Population Health Management (Table 4) presents population management tools and approaches to proactively monitor and manage hypertension in pregnancy on a practice level. Tools and approaches include clinician-driven treatment protocols and using practice data to drive improvement.
- Individual Patient Supports (Table 5) lists ways that practices can support individual patients to better manage their hypertension. These supports span the patient care spectrum, including pre-visit patient outreach, check-in opportunities, interactions during the visit, checkout, and after-visit reinforcement.

## How to Measure Quality Improvement Efforts

It is essential to monitor and measure QI efforts-both outcomes and processes. Overall outcomes such as improved BP control (see Appendix D for more information on clinical quality measures) are important to measure, but it is also important to monitor process measures, such as the percentage of pregnant women at higher risk of preeclampsia who are prescribed aspirin prophylaxis. These types of data can provide much-needed feedback on whether the interventions you are using are being consistently implemented.

Begin by collecting baseline data on a process that you are interested in improving. Then test your 'change ideas' on a pilot scale using a

Figure 6. Example of a Run Chart

<!-- image -->

small number of patients and discuss identified potential barriers to implementation with staff. These small tests of change can be used to assess the success of implementing an intervention and allow staff to make needed refinements prior to scaling up the project to a larger level.

A helpful tool for displaying and monitoring efforts over time is a run chart, a graph that displays performance on a given process or outcome longitudinally. It can be useful to chart performance over time to inform decision makers and other interested parties of the reasons recommended changes are needed. You can then document when specific changes were made to show the impact that implemented changes yielded on performance ( Figure 6 ). See Appendix C for additional QI tools and resources.

## Appendix B: Self-Measured Blood Pressure (SMBP) Monitoring

In the general population, SMBP , also known as home blood pressure monitoring, defined as measurement of BP outside of the office setting, is an evidence-based, cost-effective way to improve BP control, particularly when combined with clinical support. 86, 89 Recommendations for SMBP in the general population, for both confirming new diagnoses of hypertension and managing medication adjustments, are included in several guidelines and task force recommendations. 51, 90

However, research on the effectiveness of SMBP in pregnancy on improving outcomes is less robust thus far, in part due to heterogeneity of populations, methods, and outcomes studied. Meta-analyses suggest that SMBP is accurate, feasible, and safe in pregnancy. 91-92 And despite a lack of definitive evidence of improved outcomes, a recent comparative effectiveness review of hypertension management in postpartum women concluded that SMBP may allow for early recognition of hypertension and may address race-based inequities in follow-up. 82 Further, an expert consensus document gave a strong recommendation for SMBP for women at risk of preeclampsia, recognizing the potential benefits, low likelihood of harm, and cost-effectiveness. 70 SMBP combined with telemedicine for women at risk of preeclampsia can also address barriers to attending frequent antenatal care visits in person. 70

Incorporating SMBP into practice depends on accurate BP measurement and appropriate response to SMBP readings. Below are some important considerations when using SMBP in pregnant or postpartum women.

## Arm Circumference

Properly fitting BP cuffs are essential for accurate readings, both in clinical settings and for SMBP . 93 BP cuff sizes are not standardized across or within device manufacturers, so measuring a patient's arm circumference and providing that value to them may help them obtain a properly sized cuff. 94 Pregnancy-associated weight gain could impact arm circumference. As a pregnancy progresses, it may prove helpful to remeasure arm circumference to ensure a properly sized cuff is used, both for in-office measurement and for SMBP . 86

## SMBP Devices Validated in Pregnant Populations

Automatic upper arm devices are preferred to wrist cuffs for most patients. Wrist cuffs can be used for women with very large or conical upper arms, though attention to proper positioning is important for accurate readings. 93, 95 Not all SMBP devices have been clinically validated for use in pregnant women, which is imperative due to increases in blood volume during pregnancy.

U.S. Blood Pressure Validated Device

The

Listing , from the American Medical Association, is a reliable source of clinically validated SMBP devices and allows users to filter by pregnant populations. STRIDE BP , from the European Society of Hypertension, International Society of Hypertension, and World Hypertension League, is another source of SMBP devices that have been validated in pregnancy. 50, 96

## Proper Preparation and Positioning

It is essential to teach patients how to prepare and position themselves to obtain accurate blood pressure measurements; this is pertinent to in-office measurement as well. Actions that can improve accuracy include ( Figure 3 ):

- Having an empty bladder
- Avoiding caffeine and exercise for 30 minutes before measuring
- Sitting in a chair with back supported, feet flat on the floor and arm at heart level
- Placing cuff on a bare arm
- Resting quietly for 5 minutes before measuring
- Not talking, actively listening, or using electronic devices during measurement 93, 95

## Clinical Protocol

SMBP has been shown to be more accurate than in-office readings, in part because SMBP is digested as an average of a pattern of readings. Most experts agree that a typical protocol for diagnosing new cases of hypertension or monitoring medication changes in nonpregnant patients with hypertension is to obtain two readings 5 minutes apart in the morning and two readings 5 minutes apart in the evening for up to 7 days (no fewer than 3 days). 93, 95 This provides up to 28 readings, which are then averaged for a representative blood pressure value.

## SMBP Device Coverage

Currently, insurance coverage for SMBP devices is variable in private plans. Forty-two states provide some level of device coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries (as of February 2024), though coverage varies substantially. 97 Medicaid device coverage averages $63.76, but ranges from $8.22 (Arkansas) to $159.44 (New Hampshire). Many clinically validated devices can be purchased for $50-100, but if an extra-large cuff is needed, the device will likely cost $100 or more. 98

## Appendix C: Additional Quality Improvement (QI) Resources

If you are new to continuous QI, there are many useful QI tools that can assist you in your efforts. For example, the IHI provides several QI tools that support its Model for Improvement ( Figure 4 ). Its Quality Improvement Essentials Toolkit is a good primer for those beginning their quality improvement journey. The toolkit includes the Improvement Project Planning Form to help teams think systematically about their improvement project and the PDSA Worksheet for Testing Change , which walks the user through documenting a test of change. These resources may be helpful for planning, assigning responsibilities, and carrying out small tests of change for improving care of women with hypertension in pregnancy.

Another useful QI reference and toolkit is the Guide to Improving Care Processes and Outcomes , available from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which supports the U.S. health care safety net. This resource includes worksheets, such as the Clinical Decision Support-enabled Quality

Improvement Worksheet for analyzing current workflows and information flows and considering improvements for targets such as BP control or aspirin prophylaxis. The HPCP can help identify promising evidence-informed approaches to enhancing care processes to achieve this goal.

Finally, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) publishes a CDS 5 Rights framework on improving care delivery and outcomes with clinical decision support (CDS). These guidebooks can help you apply the CDS 5 Rights framework to ensure that all the right people (including patients) get the right information in the right formats via the right channels at the right times to optimize healthrelated decisions and actions. The guidebooks help health care practices and their partners set up programs that reliably deliver outcome improving CDS interventions. They also provide detailed guidance on how to successfully develop, launch, and monitor such interventions so that all interested parties benefit.

## Appendix D: Clinical Quality Measures Related to Hypertension in Pregnancy

Quality improvement efforts are often anchored in clinical quality measures. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Quality Payment Program (QPP) has a specialty measure set included in the 2023 Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). It includes 27 measures, four of which are very pertinent to hypertension in pregnancy ( Table 6 ). CMS22 assesses BP screening and documentation of follow-up for people with elevated BP . This measure includes pregnant women but does not assess BP treatment or control. CMS165 assesses BP control among people with a diagnosis of essential hypertension but excludes pregnant women from the denominator. MIPS Quality ID #336 assesses postpartum follow-up care but does not include postpartum hypertension screening or management. MIPS Quality ID #487 assesses screening for the social drivers of health but excludes patients under the age of 18, regardless of pregnancy status. These four measures represent opportunities for specification enhancement to better assess aspects of care related to hypertension in pregnancy.
