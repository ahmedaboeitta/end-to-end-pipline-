Before you became pregnant (with your (NTH) pregnancy which ended in (DATE)/this time), was the reason you did not use any birth control methods because you, yourself, wanted to become pregnant?

(IF USED A METHOD BETWEEN FIRST SEX/LAST PREGNANCY AND THIS ONE:)

You told me you had stopped using a birth control method before you became pregnant (with your (NTH) pregnancy which ended in (DATE)/this time). Was the reason you had stopped using any methods because you yourself wanted to become pregnant?

(IF DID NOT USE A METHOD BETWEEN FIRST SEX/LAST PREGNANCY AND THIS ONE:)

You did not use any method of birth control from (your first intercourse/[BABY NAME's] birth in [DATE]/your [Nth] pregnancy which ended in [DATE]) until you became pregnant (with your (NTH) pregnancy which ended in (DATE)/this time). Was the reason you were not using any methods because you yourself wanted to become pregnant?
