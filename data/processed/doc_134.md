## FOREWORD

## -  Dr.  C.  GOPALAN

## Founder President

Nutrition Foundation of India

It is now more than a decade since this valuable publication was first prepared. It  was  compiled  by  a  team  of  experienced  nutrition  scientists  at  the  National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad,  under  the leadership of Dr.  Kamala Krishnaswamy. It has received wide appreciation from the general public as well as from students of nutrition, medicine, home science, nursing and allied subjects, and has been reprinted several times. It has also been widely disseminated through outreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of lectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages.

In the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in India.  It  was  thought  necessary  to  update  the  guidelines  in  the  light  of  new developments and fresh information.

The most notable change has been in the overall economic scenario in the country,  with  a  robust  growth  rate.  There  have  also  been  some  important government initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation, including the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS. Globalisation has  resulted  in  the  opening  of  multinational  fast  food  chains  in  Indian  cities, including the smaller cities. Lifestyles and dietary patterns that had started giving early  warning  signals  towards  the  end  of  the  previous  century,  when  these guidelines were first published, are continuing to follow a trend that promotes obesity and the attendant non communicable diseases.

The improvement in the overall economy at the macro level and concomitant improvements  in  purchasing  power  (though  unevenly  distributed)  among households have not led to the expected levels of improvement in the nutritional status of Indians. The latest findings of the National Family Health Survey, NFHS-3 showed virtually no improvement in parameters as compared to NFHS-2, and recent surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau have thrown more light  on  the  growing  problem  of  the  'double  burden'  of  undernutrition  and overnutrition. These data should serve as a wake-up call to nutritionists and policy makers.  There  is  very  obviously  an  'awareness  and  information  deficit',  even among the more affluent sections of the population, about good dietary practices and their linkage with good health. This deficit should be narrowed and eliminated by  harnessing  all  traditional  as  well  as  modern  technological  vehicles  of communication.

This updated version of DGI from India's premier nutrition institute, National Institute of Nutrition, should serve as a valuable source of concise, accurate and accessible information, both for members of the general public and those who are involved in dissemination of nutrition and health education.

## PREFACE

The first edition of 'Dietary Guidelines' was published in 1998, and since then many  changes  have  taken  place  in  the  country.  The  economic  transition  has transformed the way people live. Changing lifestyles of people both in rural and urban areas are seen to alter the very structure of our society at a rapid pace today. The shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased intake of processed and ready-to-eat foods, intensive marketing of junk foods and 'health' beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary behaviour. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The increasing  number  of  overweight  and  obese  people  in  the  community  and  the resulting  burden  of  chronic  non-communicable  diseases  necessitate  systematic nutrition educational interventions on a massive scale. There is a need for adoption of  healthy  dietary  guidelines  along  with  strong  emphasis  on  regular  physical exercise.

Today, the multiple sources of health and nutrition related information tend to create unnecessary confusion among people. This book makes an attempt to inform us on matters of everyday nutrition in a user friendly manner and thus, aims to influence our dietary behavior. These guidelines deal with nutritional requirements of people during all stages of their life, right from infancy to old age.

We earnestly hope that readers will enjoy reading the book and benefit from it and also spread the valuable information among those around them.

## INTRODUCTION

Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development and to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and distribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and   technical in nature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components (non-nutrient  phytochemicals)  which  have  a  positive  impact  on  health.  Since people consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather than nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to the food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines are a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. They represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets that should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of nutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old age.

Formulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing required  guidance  to  people  in  ensuring  nutritional  adequacy.  The  dietary guidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological or high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and health personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the goals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition.

The dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the prevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the social,  economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines can be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to reach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy.

The  major  food  issues  of  concern  are  insufficient/  imbalanced  intake  of foods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in India are low  birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy deficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and  diet-related  noncommunicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of malnutrition (under and overnutrition) are important. Recent evidences indicate  that  undernutrition in  utero may  set  the  pace  for  diet-related    chronic diseases in later life. Population explosion, demographic  changes, rapid urbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of certain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related chronic diseases. nutrition

The  dietary  guidelines  emphasize  promotion  of  health  and  prevention  of disease,  of  all  age  groups  with  special  focus  on  vulnerable  segments  of  the population  such  as  infants,  children  and  adolescents,  pregnant  and  lactating women  and  the  elderly.  Other  related  factors,  which  need  consideration  are physical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development, all of which strongly influence nutrition and health.

In this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which can maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with traditional habits.  The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as pulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy decisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted.

A variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common man, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only four accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations and culinary practices.  Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from a  variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The cooking oils and fat used are of several kinds.   The proposed guidelines help to formulate  health  promoting  recipes  and  diets  which  are  region-  and  culturespecific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of India. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.

Translation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several government and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed, herein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance of  optimal  health.  Effective  IEC  strategies  and  other  large-scale  educational campaigns  should  be  launched  to  encourage  people  to  follow  the  dietary guidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition and health programs.

## CURRENT  DIET  AND  NUTRITION  SCENARIO

Health  and  nutrition  are  the  most  important  contributory  factors  for  human resource development in the country.  India has been classified by the World Bank 1 as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-3945 . It th ranks 160  in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian population, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be 2 below the poverty line , which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban areas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable chronic  diet  related  disorders,  increased  morbidity  and  mortality  and  reduced physical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines development.

## Common Nutrition Problems

Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum  communities.

Undernutrition  starts  as  early  as  during  conception.  Because  of  extensive maternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, nutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with 3 low  birth-weight  (&lt;2500  g) ,  as  compared  to  less  than  10%  in  the  developed countries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even during early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is &lt;1 %, national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) &lt;5 year children suffer from subclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which 3 indicates that undernutrition is of long duration . The studies have shown that there is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% 4 at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age . This is attributable to faulty infant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community.

Persistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to short stature in adults.   About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body 2 Mass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter) ] below 18.5, which indicates 4 Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1) . In the case of vitamin  A deficiency, 0.81%  of  preschool  children  show  the  signs  of  Bitot's  spots  and  night  blindness. Vitamin  A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death.

3 Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)  are anemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence 5 of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women . It is 6 estimated that nutritional  anemia  contributes  to  about  24%   of  maternal  deaths every year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight.  It adversely affects work output among adults and learning ability in children.

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of population in several parts of the country.   About 167 million are estimated to be living in IDD endemic areas.  Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular disorders.  The  most  important  consequence  of  iodine  deficiency  in  mothers  is cretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from the birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to maternal iodine deficiency.  Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, 7 2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps .

India is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem of undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is emerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of overweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in 4 8 rural  areas . The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus  and Coronary Heart Disease 9 (CHD)  is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The incidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to 10 men (113 for 100,000) .

## Food availability and consumption

The  overall  production  of  food  grains  (cereals/millets/pulses)  recorded  a significant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million 11,12 tones during 2007-2008 .  Though the production of cereals and millets appears to be adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually shows a decline.  Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand 13 of 100 million tones .  The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 million tones,  corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than 14 the world average of 285 g per day . Though the per capita availability of various foods  stuffs  is  comparable  to  RDA,  the  distribution  of  foods,  both  within  the community and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low income and purchasing power.  In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of the Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low nutrient bio-availability (Table 2).

4 National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys  indicate that the daily intake of all foods except cereals and millets (396g) in Indian households is lower than  the  Recommended  Dietary  Allowances  or  RDA  (Table  3).  The  average consumption of pulses and legumes like green gram, bengal gram and black gram, which are important source of protein was less than 50% of RDA.  Consumption of green leafy vegetables (&lt;14g) and other vegetables (43 g), which are rich sources of micronutrients like beta-carotene, folate, calcium, riboflavin and iron  was  grossly inadequate. Intake of visible fat was also less than 50% of the RDA.

The proportion of households with energy inadequacy was about 70%, while that with protein inadequacy was about 27%. Thus, in the cereal/millet-based Indian dietaries, the primary bottleneck is energy inadequacy and not the protein, as was earlier  believed. This dietary energy gap can be easily reduced by the poor by increasing the quantities of habitually eaten foods.

On the other side of the spectrum of malnutrition, diet-related non-communicable diseases are commonly seen. With increasing urbanization, energy-rich diets containing higher amount of fat and sugar, which also provide less dietary fibre and complex  carbohydrates,  are  being  frequently  consumed,  particularly  by  highincome groups.  In addition, the urban population is turning to be more sedentary with little physical activity. Consumption of alcohol, providing empty calories, and tobacco use is also common among them. Hence, prevalence of disorders like obesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes and certain types of cancers is on the increase.

## Determinants of Malnutrition

Widespread  malnutrition  is  largely  a  result  of  dietary  inadequacy  and unhealthy lifestyles. Other contributing factors are poor purchasing power, faulty feeding habits, large family size, frequent infections, poor health care, inadequate sanitation and low agricultural production. Population living in the backward and drought-prone rural areas and urban slums, and those belonging to the socially backward  groups  like  scheduled  castes  and  tribal  communities  are  highly susceptible to undernutrition. Similarly, landless labourers and destitutes are also at a higher risk.

The  most  rational,  sustainable  and  long-term  solution  to  the  problem  of malnutrition  is  ensuring  availability,  accessability  and  consumption  of  adequate amounts of foods. Dietary guidelines help to achieve the objective of providing optimal nutrition to the population.

## Why do we need nutritionally adequate food?

Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and development, maintenance of normal body function, physical activity and health. Nutritious food is, thus needed to sustain life and activity. Our diet must provide all essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements of essential nutrients vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition (deficiency diseases) or overnutrition (diseases of affluence) respectively. Eating too little food during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy  and  lactation  and  eating  too  much  at  any  age  can  lead  to  harmful consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our lives. The nutrients must be obtained through a judicious choice and combination of a variety of foodstuffs from different food groups (Figure 1).

Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are macronutrients, which are needed in large amounts. Vitamins and minerals constitute the micronutrients and are required in small amounts. These nutrients are necessary for physiological and biochemical processes by which the human body acquires, assimilates and utilizes  food  to maintain health and activity.

## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are either simple or complex, and are major sources of energy in all  human  diets.  They  provide  energy  of  4  Kcal/g.  The  simple  carbohydrates, glucose and fructose, are found in fruits, vegetables and honey, sucrose in sugar and lactose in milk, while the complex polysaccharides are starches in cereals, millets, pulses and root vegetables and glycogen in animal foods. The other complex carbohydrates which are resistant to digestion in the human digestive tract are cellulose in vegetables and whole grains, and gums and pectins in vegetables, fruits and cereals, which constitute the dietary fibre component. In India, 70-80% of total dietary  calories  are  derived  from  carbohydrates  present  in  plant  foods  such  as cereals, millets and pulses.

Dietary  fibre  delays  and  retards  absorption  of  carbohydrates  and  fats  and increases the satiety value. Diets rich in fibre reduce glucose and lipids in blood and increase the bulk of the stools. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier than low-fibre diets based on refined and processed foods.

## Proteins

Proteins are primary structural and functional components of every living cell. Almost half the protein in our body is in the form of muscle and the rest of it is in bone, cartilage and skin. Proteins are complex molecules composed of different amino acids. Certain amino acids which are termed 'essential', have to be obtained from proteins in the diet since they are not synthesized in the human body. Other nonessential amino acids can be synthesized in the body to build proteins. Proteins perform a wide range of functions and also provide energy (4 Kcal/g).

Protein  requirements  vary  with  age,  physiological  status  and  stress.  More proteins  are  required  by  growing  infants  and  children,  pregnant  women  and individuals during infections and illness or stress. Animal foods like milk, meat, fish and eggs and plant foods such as pulses and legumes are rich sources of proteins. Animal proteins are of high quality as they provide all the essential amino acids in right  proportions,  while  plant  or  vegetable  proteins  are  not  of  the  same  quality because of their low content of some of the essential amino acids. However, a combination of cereals, millets and pulses provides most of the amino acids, which complement each other to provide better quality proteins.

## Fats

Oils and fats such as butter, ghee and vanaspathi constitute dietary visible fats. Fats are a concentrated source of energy providing 9 Kcal/g, and are made up of fatty acids in different proportions.  Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the invisible fat present in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats  and oils (cooking oil). Fats serve as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins  A, D, E and K and carotenes and promote their absorption. They are also sources of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is necessary to have adequate and good quality fat in the diet with sufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids in proper proportions for meeting the requirements of essential fatty acids (Refer chapter 7).  The type and quantity of fat in the daily diet influence the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Diets should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the case of infants and children,  to  provide  concentrated  energy  since  their  energy  needs  per  kg  body weight are nearly twice those of adults. Adults need to be cautioned to restrict intake of saturated fat (butter, ghee and hydrogenated fats) and cholesterol (red meat, eggs, organ meat). Excess of these substances could lead to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.

## Vitamins and minerals

Vitamins are chemical compounds required by the body in small amounts. They must be present in the diet as they cannot be synthesized in the body. Vitamins are essential for numerous body processes and for maintenance of the structure of skin, bone, nerves, eye, brain, blood and mucous membrane. They are either watersoluble or fat-soluble. Vitamins  A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, while vitamin C, and the

B-complex vitamins

such as

thiamin riboflavin  (B ),  niacin,  pyridoxine  (B ),  folic

2

6

acid and cyanocobalamin (B

) are water-

12

soluble. Pro-vitamin like beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body.

Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body while water-soluble vitamins

are not and get easily excreted in urine.

Vitamins  B-complex  and  C  are  heat labile vitamins and are easily destroyed

by heat, air or during drying, cooking and food processing.

Minerals are inorganic elements found  in  body  fluids  and  tissues.  The important macro minerals are sodium,

<!-- image -->

potassium,  calcium,  phosphorus,  magnesium  and  sulphur,  while  zinc,  copper, selenium, molybdenum, fluorine, cobalt, chromium and iodine are micro minerals. They are required for maintenance and integrity of skin, hair, nails, blood and soft tissues. They also govern nerve cell transmission, acid/base and fluid balance, enzyme and hormone activity as well as the blood- clotting processes. Approximate calorific value of nuts, salads and fruits are given in annexure 1.

## What is a balanced diet?

A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and proper proportions. It can easily be achieved through a blend of the four basic food groups.  The quantities of foods needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with age,  gender,  physiological  status  and  physical  activity.  A  balanced  diet  should provide  around  50-60%  of  total  calories  from  carbohydrates,  preferably  from complex carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible and invisible fat.

In addition, a balanced diet should provide other non-nutrients such as dietary fibre,  antioxidants  and  phytochemicals  which  bestow  positive  health  benefits. Antioxidants  such  as  vitamins  C  and  E,  beta-carotene,  riboflavin  and  selenium protect the human body from free radical damage. Other phytochemicals such as polyphenols, flavones, etc., also afford protection against  oxidant damage. Spices like turmeric, ginger, garlic, cumin and  cloves are rich in antioxidants. Balanced Diet for Adults - Sedentary/Moderate/Heavy Activity is given in annexure 2 and figures 3 &amp; 4. Also, sample menu plans for sedentary adult man and woman are   given in annexure 2a and 2b respectively.

## What are food groups ?

Foods are conventionally grouped as :

- 1.Cereals, millets and pulses
- 3.Milk and milk products, egg, meat and fish
- 2.Vegetables and fruits
- 4.Oils &amp; fats and nuts &amp; oilseeds

However, foods may also be classified according to their functions (Table 4).

## What are nutrient requirements and recommended dietary allowances (RDA)?

Requirements are the quantities of nutrients that healthy individuals must obtain from food to meet their physiological needs. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the requirements of all individuals in a given population. The recommended level depends upon the bioavailability of nutrients from a given diet. The term bioavailability indicates what is absorbed and utilized by the body. In addition, RDA includes a margin of safety, to cover variation between individuals, dietary traditions and practices. The RDAs are

suggested  for  physiological  groups  such  as  infants,  pre-schoolers,  children, adolescents, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adult men and women, taking into  account  their  physical  activity.  In  fact,  RDAs  are  suggested  averages/day. However,  in  practice,  fluctuations  in  intake  may  occur  depending  on  the  food availability and demands of the body. But, the average requirements need to be satisfied over a period of time (Annexure-3).

Our diet must provide adequate calories, proteins and micronutrients to achieve maximum growth potential. Therefore, it is important to have appropriate diet during different stages of one's life (Figure 2). There may be situations where adequate amounts of nutrients may not be available through diet alone. In such high risk situations  where  specific  nutrients  are  lacking,  foods  fortified  with  the  limiting nutrient(s) become necessary. A good example of such fortified foods is the salt fortified with iron and iodine.

## Guideline  2

## Ensure  provision  of  extra  food  and  healthcare  to pregnant  and  lactating  women

Rationale: Additional food and extra care are required during pregnancy and lactation

- /c63 Pregnancy is physiologically and nutritionally a highly demanding period. Extra food is required to meet the requirements of the fetus.
- /c63 A woman prepares herself to meet the nutritional demands by increasing her own body fat deposits during pregnancy.
- /c63 A lactating mother requires extra food to secrete adequate quantity/ quality of milk and to safe guard her own health.

## Why additional diet is required during pregnancy and lactation ?

Pregnancy is a demanding physiological state.  In India, it is observed that diets of women from the low socioeconomic groups are essentially similar during prepregnant,  pregnant  and  lactating  periods.  Consequently,  there  is  widespread maternal malnutrition leading to high prevalence of low birth weight infants and very high maternal mortality. Additional foods are required to improve weight gain in pregnancy (10-12 Kg) and birth weight of infants (about 3 Kg).

## What are the nutrients that require special attention ?

The daily diet of a woman should contain an additional 350 calories, 0.5 g of protein during first trimester and 6.9 g during second trimester and 22.7 g during third trimester of pregnancy.  Some  micronutrients  are  specially  required  in extra amounts during these physiological periods. Folic acid, taken throughout the pregnancy, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and increases the birth weight. The mother as well as the growing fetus needs iron to meet the high demands  of  erythropoiesis  (RBC  formation).  Calcium  is essential,  both  during  pregnancy  and  lactation,  for  proper formation of bones and teeth of the offspring, for secretion of breast-milk rich in calcium and to prevent osteoporosis in the mother.  Similarly,  iodine  intake  ensures  proper  mental health of the growing fetus and infant. Vitamin A is required

<!-- image -->

during lactation to improve child and C need to be taken by the lactating mother. survival. Besides these, nutrients like vitamins B 12

## How can the pregnant and lactating women meet these nutritional demands?

The pregnant/lactating woman should eat a wide variety of foods to make sure that her own nutritional needs as well as those of her growing foetus are met. There is no particular need to modify the usual dietary pattern. However, the quantity and frequency of usage of the different foods should be increased. She can derive maximum amount of energy (about 60%) from rice, wheat and millets. Cooking oil is a concentrated source of both energy and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Good quality protein  is  derived  from  milk,  fish,  meat,  poultry  and  eggs.  However,  a  proper combination of cereals, pulses and nuts also provides adequate proteins. Mineral and vitamin requirements are met by consuming a variety of seasonal vegetables particularly green leafy vegetables, milk and fresh fruits. Bioavailability of iron can be improved by using fermented and sprouted grams and foods rich in vitamin C such as citrus fruits. Milk is the best source of biologically available calcium. Though it is possible to meet the requirements for most of the nutrients through a balanced diet, pregnant/lactating women are advised to take daily supplements of iron, folic acid, vitamin B and calcium (Annexure 3). 12

## What additional care is required ?

Adequate intake of a nutritious diet is reflected in optimal weight gain during pregnancy (10 kg) by the expectant woman. She should choose foods rich in fibre (around 25 g/1000 kcal) like whole grain cereals, pulses and vegetables, to avoid constipation. She should take plenty of  fluids including 8-12 glasses of water per day.  Salt  intake  should  not  be  restricted  even  to  prevent  pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Excess intake of beverages containing caffeine like coffee and tea adversely affect fetal growth and hence, should be avoided.

In  addition  to  satisfying  these  dietary  requisites,  a  pregnant  woman  should undergo periodic health check-up for weight gain, blood pressure, anaemia and receive tetanus toxoid immunization. She requires enough physical exercise with adequate rest for 2-3 hrs during the day. Pregnant and lactating women should not indiscriminately take any drugs without medical advice, as some of them could be harmful  to  the  fetus/baby.  Smoking  and  tobacco  chewing  and  consumption  of alcohol should be avoided. Wrong food beliefs and taboos should be discouraged.

The most important food safety problem is microbial food borne illness and its prevention during pregnancy is one of the important public health measure.  Avoiding contaminated foods is important protective measure against food borne illness.

## POINTS TO PONDER

- /c118 Eat more food during pregnancy.
- /c118 Eat more whole grains, sprouted grams and fermented foods.
- /c118 Take milk/meat/eggs in adequate amounts.
- /c118 Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits.
- /c118 Avoid superstitions and food taboos.
- /c118 Do not use alcohol and tobacco. Take medicines only when prescribed.
- /c118 Take iron, folate and calcium supplements regularly, after 14-16 weeks of  pregnancy and continue the same during lactation.

## EAT FOLATE-RICH FOODS

- /c63 Folic acid is essential for the synthesis of haemoglobin.
- /c63 Folic acid deficiency leads to macrocytic anaemia.
- /c63 Pregnant women need more of folic acid.
- /c63 Folic  acid  supplements  increase  birth  weight  and  reduce  congenital anomalies.
- /c63 Green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folic acid.
- /c63 500 m g (0.5mg) folic acid supplementation is advised preconceptionally and through out pregnancy for women with history of congenital anomalies (neural tube defects, cleft palate).

## EAT IRON-RICH FOODS

## Guideline  3

## Promote  exclusive  breastfeeding  for  six  months  and encourage  breastfeeding  till  two  years  or  more, if  possible

Rationale: Exclusive breast-feeding ensures safe nutrition to the infant and all round development of health

- /c63 Breast-milk is the most natural and perfect food for normal growth and healthy development of infants.
- /c63 Colostrum is rich in nutrients and anti-infective factors and should be fed to infants.
- /c63 Breast-feeding reduces risk of infections.
- /c63 It  establishes mother-infant contact and promotes mother-child bonding.
- /c63 It  prolongs birth interval by fertility control (delayed return of menstruation).
- /c63 Breast-feeding helps in retraction of the uterus.
- /c63 Incidence of breast cancer is lower in mothers who breast feed their children.
- /c63 Breast feeding is associated with better cognitive development of children and may provide some long-term health benefits.

## Why breast-feed the infant?

Breast-milk contains all essential nutrients needed for the infant; it provides the best nutrition and protects the infant from infections. Breast-milk is a natural food and is more easily digested and absorbed by the infant as compared to formula milk prepared from other sources. Colostrum, which is the milk secreted during the first 34 days after child birth, is rich in proteins, minerals, vitamins especially vitamin  A and antibodies.  In  addition,  it  has  a  laxative  effect  as  well.  Breast-feeding  helps  in reducing fertility and facilitates spacing of children. Lactation provides emotional satisfaction to the mother and the infant. Recent evidence suggests that human milk may confer some long term benefits such as lower risk of certain autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and related disorders and probably some cancers. Therefore, breast milk is the best milk for the newborn and growing infant.

## What are the advantages of breast-milk?

In addition to providing nutrients, breast-milk has several special components such as growth factors, enzymes, hormones and anti-infective factors. The amount

of milk secreted increases gradually in the first few days after delivery, reaching the peak during the second month, at which level it is maintained until about 6 months of age. An average Indian woman secretes about 750 ml of milk per day during the first 6 months and 600 ml/day subsequently up to one year. Many essential components are in concentrated amounts  in colostrum as compared  to  mature  milk, compensating for the low output during early lactation.

Breast-milk provides good quality proteins, fat, vitamins, calcium, iron and other minerals up to 4-6 months. In fact, quality of some of the nutrients can be improved by supplementing the diet of the mother with nutrients. Growth performance of majority of the breast-fed infants is satisfactory up to 6 months of age.   Breast feeding is associated with better cognitive development possibly due to the high content  of  docosahexaeonic  acid  (DHA)  which  plays  an  important  role  in  brain development.

## When to start breast feeding and how long to continue?

Mother-infant contact should be established as early as possible (immediately after birth) by permitting the infant to suck at the breast. Mothers can breast-feed from as early as 30 minutes after delivery. Colostrum should be made available to the infant immediately after birth. Feeding honey, glucose, water or dilute milk formula before lactation should be avoided and the infant should be allowed to suck, which helps  in  establishing  lactation.  Colostrum  should  not  be discarded, as is sometimes practiced.

Breast-feeding in India is common among the rural and urban poor, being less so among the urban middle and upper classes. The poorer groups continue breastfeeding for longer duration than the educated upper and middle income groups. The economically advantaged or the working mother tends to discontinue breast-feeding early. A baby should be exclusively breast-fed only up to 6 months and complementary foods should be introduced thereafter. Breast-feeding can be continued as long as possible, even up to 2 years. Demand feeding helps in maintaining lactation for a longer time. If babies are quiet or sleep for 2 hours after a feed and show adequate weight gain, feeding may be assumed as adequate. Breast-fed infants do not  need  additional  water.  Feeding  water  reduces  the  breast  milk  intake  and increases the risk of diarrhoea and should, therefore, be avoided. Giving additional water is unnecessary even in hot climate.

## What are the effects of maternal malnutrition on breast-milk?

Composition of breast-milk depends to some extent on maternal nutrition.   In general, even the undernourished mothers can successfully breast-feed. But in the case of severe malnutrition, both the quality and quantity of breast-milk may be affected.  Protein  content  of  breast-milk  appears  to  be  much  less  affected  as compared to fat in malnutrition. Concentration of water-soluble vitamins as well as fat soluble vitamin A (beta-carotene) is influenced by the quality of the maternal diet. Supplementation of vitamins A and B-complex to lactating mothers increases the levels of these vitamins in breast-milk. Zinc and iron from breast-milk are better absorbed than from other food sources. Trace element composition of breast-milk, however, is not affected by the mother's nutritional status.

## How does breast-milk protect against infection ?

Diseases and death among breast-fed infants are much lower than those among formula-fed infants. Breast-feeding protects against diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections. The bifidus factor in breast-milk promotes the natural gut flora. The gut flora and the low pH of breast-milk inhibit the growth of pathogens. Breast-milk has immunoglobulins (IgA), lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and complements which protect the infant from several infections. Antibodies to E-coli and some viruses are found in breast milk, which protect the gut mucosa. Breast-feeding also protects infants from vulnerability to  allergic reactions.

## What ensures an adequate supply of breast-milk?

It is necessary that the woman is emotionally prepared during pregnancy for breast-feeding and is encouraged to eat a well-balanced diet.  Anxiety and emotional upset must be avoided and adequate rest should be ensured. It is necessary to prepare the breast, particularly the nipple, for breast-feeding. Mother should initiate breast-feeding as early as possible after delivery and feed the child on demand. Milk production of the mother is determined by the infant's demand. Frequent sucking by the baby and complete emptying of breast are important for sustaining adequate breast  milk  output. A  working  mother  can  express  her  breast  milk  and  store  it hygienically up to 8 hrs. This can be fed to her infant by the caretaker.

## Are drugs secreted in breast-milk ?

Since, drugs (antibiotics, caffeine, hormones and alcohol) are secreted into the breast-milk and could prove harmful to the breast-fed infant, caution should be exercised by the lactating mother while taking medicines.

## Should HIV positive women breast feed their babies?

HIV may be transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk. However, women living in the resource poor settings in developing countries may not have access to safe, hygienic and affordable replacement feeding options. Considering the  important  role  of  breast  milk  in  child  growth  and  development,  following recommendations  have  been  proposed  by  National AIDS  Control  Organization (NACO).  When  replacement  feeding  is  not  acceptable,  feasible,  affordable, sustainable and safe (AFASS), exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the first months of life. Every effort should be made to promote exclusive breast-feeding for up to four months in the case of HIV positive mothers followed by weaning, and complete stoppage of breast feeding at six months in order to restrict transmission through breast feeding. However, such mothers will be informed about the risk of transmission of HIV through breast milk and its consequences. In addition, based on the principle of informed choice, HIV infected women should be counseled about the risk  of  HIV transmission through breast milk and the risks and benefits of each feeding method, with specific guidance in selecting the option most likely to be suitable for their situation. In any case, mixed feeding i.e. breast-feeding along with other  feeds  should  be  strictly  discouraged  as  it  increases  the  risk  of  HIV transmission.

## POINTS TO PONDER

- /c63 Start breast-feeding within an hour after delivery and do not discard colostrum.
- /c63 Breast-feed exclusively (not even water) for a minimum of six months if  the  growth of the infant is adequate.
- /c63 Continue breast-feeding in addition to nutrient-rich complementary foods (weaning foods), preferably up to 2 years.
- /c63 Breast-feed  the  infant  frequently  and  on  demand  to  establish  and maintain good milk supply.
- /c63 Take a nutritionally adequate diet both during pregnancy and lactation.
- /c63 Avoid  tobacco  (smoking  and  chewing),  alcohol  and  drugs  during lactation.
- /c63 Ensure active family support for breast-feeding.

## Guideline  4

## Feed  home  based  semi-solid  foods  to  the  infant  after six  months

Easy  to  cook  home  made  preparations  are  hygenic  and

Rationale: healthy foods for the growing baby

- /c69 Breast-milk alone is not adequate for the infant beyond 6 months of age.
- /c69 Introduction of food supplements (semi-solid complementary foods) along with breast-feeding is necessary for infants after 6 months of age.
- /c69 Provision  of  adequate  and  appropriate  supplements  to  young  children prevents malnutrition.
- /c69 Hygienic  practices  should  be  observed  while  preparing  and  feeding  the complementary food to the child; otherwise, it will lead to diarrhoea.

It is well accepted that breast milk is the best food for an infant. Fortunately, in India, most rural mothers are able to breast-feed their children for prolonged periods. In fact, this is a boon to Indian children as otherwise the prevalence of under-nutrition among them would have been much higher. However, often, children are solely breast-fed even beyond the age of one year in the belief that breast-milk alone is adequate for the child until he/she is able to pick up food and eat. This practice results in under-nutrition among young children. Working mothers, on the other hand are unable to breast-feed their children for longer periods, as they go to work outside.

## What are supplementary/complementary foods?

Foods that are regularly fed to the infant, in addition to breast-milk, providing sufficient nutrients are known as supplementary or complementary foods. These could be liquids like milk or semi-solids like 'kheer' in the case of infants or solid preparations like rice etc., in the case of children over the age of one year.

## Why use complementary foods and when?

At birth, mother's milk alone is adequate for the infant. Requirements of all the nutrients progressively increase with the infant's growth. Simultaneously, the breastmilk secretion in the mother comes down with time. Thus, infants are deprived of adequate nutrients due to the dual factors of increased nutrient requirements and decreased  availability  of  breast-milk.  Usually,  these  changes  occur  at  about  6 months of age. Hence, promotion of optimal growth in infants, calls for introduction of adequate food supplements in addition to continued breast feeding, from  the age of 6 months onwards.

## Can home-made recipes be nutritious supplements?

Low-cost food supplements can be prepared at home from commonly used ingredients such as cereals (wheat, rice, ragi ,  jowar, bajra, etc.); pulses (grams/ dhals), nuts and oilseeds (groundnut, sesame, etc.), oils (groundnut oil, sesame oil etc.) and sugar and jaggery. Such supplements are easily digested by all infants, including those with severe malnutrition. The impression that only the commercially available supplementary foods are nutritious is not correct. Some examples of low cost complementary foods are given on page 33.

## What are the principles in preparing complementary food supplements?

Weaning foods based on cereal-pulse-nut and sugar/ jaggery combinations will provide  good  quality  protein,  adequate  calories  and  other  protective  nutrients. Since infants cannot consume bulky complementary food, in sufficient quantities, energy-rich foods like fats and sugars should be included in such preparations. Infants  can  also  be  fed  green  leafy  vegetables  (GLVs),  which  are  rich,  yet inexpensive , sources of vitamins and minerals. However, greens should be well cleaned before cooking lest the infants develop loose motions. Dietary fibre in green leafy  vegetables can, by itself, promote the bowel movements leading to loose motions in infants. Since GLVs are rich in dietary fibre, it is advisable to initially feed only the juice of the GLVs after cooking them properly. Infants should be introduced to different vegetables and fruits gradually. It should, however, be remembered that these dietary articles should be thoroughly cooked and mashed before feeding. In families which can afford egg yolk and meat soup can be introduced.  At about one year of age, the child should share the family diet.

## Amylase-Rich Foods (ARFs)

Flours of germinated cereals, which are rich in the enzyme alpha-amylase, constitute ARFs. Even small amounts of this type of foods liquefy and reduce the bulk of the cereal-based diet. Thus, ARFs  help  in  increasing  the  energy density of weaning gruels and in reducing its bulk as well.

Mothers can add ARF to increase the digestibility of the low-cost weaning foods prepared at home. Preparation of ARF is very simple and can be done by mothers at home.

## How to feed a young infant?

Infants cannot eat large quantities of food in one sitting at a given time. So, they should be fed small quantities at frequent intervals (3-4 times a day). Also, the food should be of semi-solid consistency for easy swallowing. When such semi-solid foods are offered initially, the infant tends to spit it out.  This should not be mistaken as dislike for that food. The fact is that the young infant cannot achieve full coordination needed for the act of swallowing and hence, brings out the food by movements of its tongue. Physiological maturity of swallowing the semi-solid food develops when the food is regularly given every day.

## What are the hygienic practices to be adopted?

It is important to ensure that hygienic practices are scrupulously followed. All the dietary ingredients should be thoroughly cleaned. Vegetables should be washed well  to  remove  contaminants/  parasites/  pesticides  before  cutting.  Vegetables should  preferably  be  steam-cooked  to  reduce  cooking  losses.  At  the  time  of preparation and feeding of the recipes, mother should observe proper personal hygiene and the utensils used for cooking should be thoroughly washed or sterilized,

wherever possible.  A number of pre-cooked and ready-to-eat foods can be prepared for use as complementary foods (Refer page 33). Such foods should be stored in clean bottles or tins. As feeding is likely to be time consuming, the cup or the plate from which the recipe is being fed to the infant should be kept covered to protect it from  flies.  Most  often,  diarrhea  is  caused  by  unhygienic  practices  adopted  by mothers. The weaning foods which are properly cleaned and well-cooked are safe even for young infants.

## Guideline  5

## Ensure  adequate  and  appropriate  diets  for  children and  adolescents  both  in  health  and  sickness

Rationale: Well-formulated  balanced  diets for children  and adolescents help optimum growth and boosts their immunity

- A nutritionally adequate and balanced diet is essential for optimal growth and development. /c125
- /c125 Appropriate diet and physical activity during childhood is essential for optimum body composition, BMI and to reduce the risk of diet-related chronic diseases in later life  and prevent vitamin deficiency.
- /c125 Common infections and malnutrition contribute significantly to child morbidity and mortality.
- /c125 A child needs to eat more during and after episodes of infections to maintain good nutritional status.

## Why do children and adolescents require more food?

Childhood and adolescence are periods of continuous growth and development. An infant grows rapidly, doubling its birth weight by 5 months and tripling it by 1 year of age. During the second year, the child increases not only in height by 7-8 cm but also gains 4 times of its birth weight. During the pre-adolescent period the child grows, on an average, 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year and simultaneously development and maturation of various tissues and organs take place (Table 5).

Adolescent period (teenage) is spread almost over a decade. It is characterized by rapid increase in height and weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and wide swings in emotion. Adolescent growth spurt starts at about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys. The annual peak rates for height and weight are 9-10 cm and 8-10 kg. Development of critical bone mass is essential during this period as this forms the ground for maintaining mineral integrity of the bone in later life.

<!-- image -->

The pattern and proportion of various body components like body water, muscle mass, bone and fat increase during the entire childhood and adolescence to reach adult values by about 18 years. Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress than  boys  because  of  menstruation.  Their  nutritional  needs  are  of  particular importance  as  they  have  to  prepare  for  motherhood.  All  these  rapid  anabolic changes require more nutrients per unit body weight.

Growing children and adolescents require more calcium. Though recommended dietary allowances for calcium are about 600-800 mg/day, it is desirable to give higher quantities of calcium for adolescents to achieve high peak bone mass. To achieve optimal peak bone mass, it is recommended to consume calcium rich foods like milk and milk products, fox tail millet (Ragi), til etc.

Young children below the age of 5 years should be given less bulky foods, rich in energy and protein such as legumes, pulses, nuts, edible oil/ghee, sugar, milk and eggs. Vegetables including green leafy vegetables and locally available seasonal fruits should be part of their daily menu. Snacks make a useful contribution to the nutrient  requirements,  particularly  in  older  children  and  adolescents.  Frequent changes in the menu are often liked by children.

Older children and adolescents should consume plenty of milk to fulfill the high calcium  requirements.  Cooking  oils/ghee  (25-50g)  should  be  consumed.  Overindulgence  in  fats  may  be  avoided.  Excessive  salt  intake  should  be  avoided particularly by children having a family history of hypertension. Adolescence is the vulnerable  stage  for  developing  wrong  food  habits  as  well  as  bad  habits  like smoking, chewing tobacco or drinking alcohol. These should be avoided. In addition to consumption of a nutritious well balanced diet, appropriate lifestyle practices and involvement in physical activity such as games/sports should be encouraged among children and adolescents. Balanced diet for children and adolescents are given in annexure 4 and adolescent growth standards are given in annexure 5.

## How do infections in children lead to malnutrition?

Common childhood infections like diarrhea, measles and pneumonia occur in association with malnutrition and contribute to about 70% of mortality. Appropriate feeding during infection  is  essential,  which  demands  a  lot  of  patience  from  the mother.

During periods of infection, children tend to eat less due to reduced appetite. Many children vomit frequently. Nutrients are also lost in urine and faeces. The unhealthy practice of restricting diet, including breast-feeding, by the mother during any sickness could further aggravate the problem.  Hence, extra care is needed in feeding  the  child  appropriately  during  and  after  illness  to  prevent  subsequent nutritional deficiencies.

## How should a child be fed during illness?

Breast-feeds are often well accepted and tolerated even by sick children and should be continued except in severe gastroenteritis associated with shock. For older children, consuming an adult diet, soft cooked food may be offered at frequent intervals. The quantity of the feeds may be increased, after the illness has subsided, till  the  original  weight  is  regained.

## What should be done during diarrhea?

Diarrhea  is  a  common  childhood  disease  which  leads  to  dehydration  and sometimes death. The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss using oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding.

ORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger) and a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice kanji or  buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should frequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water.  During diarrhea,  feeding  should  be  continued,  though  this  goes  against  the  popular practice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus, prevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.

The diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about 1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of cereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition. Fat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense. Milk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not tolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed vegetables  may  be  incorporated  in  the  diet.  Feeding  becomes  easier  after  the infection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra food (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty.

## How important is the problem of lactose intolerance?

Deficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or chronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem. This problem can be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along with a cereal-pulse meal. There is no need to stop milk in acute diarrhoea. In chronic diarrhea, some children may develop lactose intolerance. In such children, milk may be stopped temporarily.  A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white allows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced. Adequate feeding during and after diarrhea prevents malnutrition.

## Guideline  6

## Eat  plenty  of  vegetables  and  fruits

Green leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fresh fruits are treasure trove of several minerals and vitamins and hence,

Rationale: protect from diseases

- /c161 Normal diet, to be wholesome and tasty, should include fresh vegetables and fruits, which are store houses of micronutrients
- /c161 Vegetables/fruits are rich sources of micronutrients.
- /c161 Fruits and vegetables also provide phytonutrients and fibre which are of vital health significance
- /c161 They help in prevention of micronutrient malnutrition and certain chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cataract and cancer.
- /c161 Fresh fruits are nutritionally superior to fruit juices.

## Why should we eat vegetables/fruits?

Fresh Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of micronutrients and macronutrients (Annexure 15). The micronutrients present are minerals (like iron and  calcium)  and  vitamins  (like  vitamin  C,  folic  acid,  B  complex  vitamins  and carotenoids)  whereas,  the  macronutrients  present  are  complex  carbohydrates/ fibre.  They  contain  abundant  amounts  of  iron,  calcium,  vitamin  C,  folic  acid, carotenoids (precursors of vitamin A) and phytochemicals. Some vegetables and fruits provide very low calories (Annexure 6), whereas some others such as potato, sweet potato, tapioca and yam as well as fruits like banana are rich in starch which provides energy in good amount. Therefore, vegetables and fruits can be used to increase or decrease calories in our diet.

## What functions do these nutrients and special factors in vegetables/fruits performinourbody?

## Iron

Iron is an essential element necessary for the formation of haemoglobin, the red pigment present in the red cells of blood. Haemoglobin plays an important role in the transport of oxygen to the tissues. Reduction in haemoglobin in blood leads to anaemia, a condition characterised by paleness and easy fatigue and increased susceptibility to infections. Iron is available in plenty in green leafy vegetables. But the absorption of iron is limited. Vitamin C rich foods must be consumed daily to improve iron absorption.

## Vitamin A

This  fat-soluble  vitamin  is  necessary  for  clear  vision  in  dim  light,  and  for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin A deficiency, the white of the eye (conjunctiva) loses its luster and becomes dry. In severe vitamin A deficiency, the black area of the eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in young children. Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of the body to common infections. Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green or deep yellow/orange in colour, such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, papaya, mango etc.

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. It also promotes  iron  absorption.  Vitamin  C  deficiency  is  characterised  by  weakness, bleeding gums and defective bone growth. Vitamin C is abundantly available in fresh amla, citrus fruits, guava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes. However, it is very susceptible to destruction by atmospheric oxidation. It is for this reason that when vegetables become dry and stale or cut and exposed to air most of the vitamin C originally present in destroyed.

## Folic acid

Folic acid is a haemopoietic vitamin essential for multiplication and maturation of red cells in our body. Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemias. Folic acid intake  during  pregnancy  protects  the  foetus  from  developing  certain  congenital defects. It also promotes the birth weight of infants. Folic acid deficiency increases homocysteine levels in blood, thereby increasing the risk for heart disease. Green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates.

## Calories

Many of the vegetables and fruits have low calories (Annexure 6). Large intake of low calorie vegetables and fruits can help in reducing calories in diet and help in obesity management. On the other hand vegetables like colocasia, potato, tapioca, yam, sweet potato and fruits like banana, avocado pear (215 Kcal) and mahua (111 Kcal) have more than 100 kcal per 100gram (Annexure 7).

## Phytonutrients

Vegetables provide phytochemicals and considerable health significance to the human  body.  Among  these,  dietary  fibre,  antioxidants  and  other  bio-active constituents require special mention. These special factors are required for delaying

ageing and preventing the processes which lead to diseases such as cataract, cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and cancer.

## Dietary Fibre

Dietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is important for  proper  bowel  function,  to  reduce  chronic  constipation,  diverticular disease, haemorrhoids coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. They also reduce plasma cholesterol. The protective role of dietary fibre against colon cancer has long been recognised.

## Antioxidants

In the recent past, the role of vegetables and fruits as sources of antioxidants has been receiving considerable attention. Antioxidants restrict the damage that reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components. They are of primary biological value in giving protection from certain diseases. Some of the  diseases  that  have  their  origin  in  deleterious  free  radical  reactions  are atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammatory joint diseases, asthma, diabetes etc. Raw and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus and tomatoes have been identified as good sources of antioxidants (free radicalscavengers). The nutrients vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these vegetables  are  also  potential  antioxidants.  Different  colored  vegetable  provide different  antioxidants  like  orange  colored  provide  beta-carotene,  red  provide lycopene, deep red provide betalines, blue and purple provide anthocynins.

## How much should we consume?

The  Expert  Committee  of  the  Indian  Council  of Medical  Research,  taking  into  consideration  the nutrient requirements, has recommended that every individual should consume at least 300 g of vegetables (GLV : 50 g; Other vegetables : 200 g; Roots &amp; Tubers  :  50  g)  in  a  day.  In  addition, fresh fruits  (100  g),  should  be  consumed regularly.  Since  requirements  of  iron  and folic acid are higher for pregnant women they should consume 100g of leafy vegetables daily. High calorie vegetables and fruits to be restricted for over weight/ obese subjects.

We should consume fresh, locally available and preferably seasonal vegetables and fruits. They have more micronutrients and are tasty. However, no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. The key lies in eating a variety of them and with different colors. Include commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and other vegetables, apart from those which are yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple colored citrus fruits, being vitamin C-rich enrich the diets significantly. Along with these, try selecting some new vegetables and fruits to your meals.

## How to prevent cooking losses ?

Vitamins are lost during washing of cut vegetables and cooking of foodstuffs. However,  proper  methods  of  cooking  can  substantially  reduce  these  losses. Nutrient loss is high when the vegetables are washed after cutting or when they are cut into small pieces for cooking. Consumption of properly washed raw and fresh vegetables is always beneficial.

## How do we get these foods?

Green leafy vegetables (GLVs), other vegetables and fruits are easily available. Most vegetables, particularly GLVs are inexpensive. In fact, these foods can be grown in the backyard with very little effort and cost. Even in lean seasons like summer, they can be grown using water and waste from kitchen.

## How to accommodate more servings of vegetables and fruits in a day?

To  get  the  maximum  nutritional  benefits  from  fruits  and  vegetables,  it  is important to find ways to eat more servings of vegetables and fruits per day.

## Why do we need fats?

Cooking  oils  (liquid)  and  solid  fats  together  are  referred  to  as  fats.  Fats contribute to texture, flavor and taste and increase the palatability of the diet. Fats are essential for meeting some of the nutritional needs like essential fatty acids (linoleic n-6 and alpha-linolenic n-3) and serve as rich sources of energy. Therefore, fats should be consumed, in moderation. However, for the growth of young children high-calorific diets are required. This is achieved by inclusion of adequate amounts of fat (1g fat = 9 Kcals) in their diets as they cannot consume large quantities of bulky cereal - pulse- based diets.

Fats also promote the absorption of the four fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K), impart a feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus, delay the onset of hunger.

Along with proteins, fats constitute major components of body fluids and cell membranes. The two essential fatty acids (EFA) namely, linoleic (LA n-6) and alphalinolenic  (ALA  n-3)  acids  (important  dietary  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids)  are metabolized at various sites in the body to generate a group of biologically-active compounds, which perform several important physiological functions.

## What are the sources of fat?

Dietary fats can be derived from plant and animal sources. Fats that are used as such at the table or during cooking (vegetable oils, vanaspati, butter and ghee)

are termed as 'visible' fats. Fats that are present as an integral components of various foods are referred to as 'invisible' fat. Fats, in processed and ready to eat foods are known as hidden fats. Cereals contain only 2-3% of invisible fat. However, their contribution to overall fat intake is significant as they contribute to bulk of our Indian diets. The small amounts of invisible fat present in various foods add up to a substantial level in our daily diet (about 15 g in rural population and 30g among urban middle-income and high-income groups). Most animal foods provide high amounts of invisible fat.

<!-- image -->

## How much visible fat do we need?

The total fat (visible + invisible) in the diet should provide between 20-30% of total calories. The visible fat intake in the diets can go upto 50g/person/day based on the level  of  physical  activity  and  physiological  status. Adults  with  sedentary  lifestyle should consume about 25 g of visible fat, while individuals involved in hard physical work require 30 - 40g of visible fat. Visible fat intake should be increased during pregnancy  and  lactation  to  30g.  The  higher  fat  and  EFA  requirements  during pregnancy and lactation are to meet the requirements of fetus and young infants, in view of their crucial role in physical and neuronal growth and development. Diets of young  children  and  adolescents  should  contain  about  30-50g/day.  However, ingestion of too much fat is not conducive to good health.

## What are the chemical components of fat?

Fatty acids :  All fats in foods provide mixtures of three types of fatty acids, which are the 'building blocks' of fats. Fatty acids are the primary constituents of all dietary fats.  Based  on  their  chemical  nature,  the  fatty  acids  are  broadly  grouped  as saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA). There are several fatty acids in each group. Fats from coconut oil, vanaspati , animal fats (ghee and butter) and animal foods like milk, milk products and meat provide saturated fatty acids. The short and medium chain saturated fatty acids present in ghee, butter

and coconut oil are easily digested and absorbed and are therefore, good for infants and  young  children.  However,  high  intake  of  saturated  fatty  acids  increases atherogenic risk and their intake should be limited in adults. Oils from sources such as palm, groundnut, cottonseed, sesame and olive are rich in monounsaturated fattyacids as compared to other oils. Linoleic (n-6) and -linolenic (n-3) acids are the simple PUFA, which are present only in plant foods (Table 6). All vegetable oils (except coconut) are good sources of linoleic(n-6) acid. Soyabean, rapeseed and mustard oils are the only vegetable oils, which contribute significant proportion of a -linolenic (n-3) acid. Legumes/pulses mustard and fenugreek seeds and green leafy vegetables are also good sources of a -linolenic (n-3) acid (Table 7). On the other hand, fish and fish oils provide long chain n-3 fatty acids, which are biologically more active than alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid present in plant foods. a

Table - 6 Major Types of Fatty Acids in Fats and Oils

Dietary  fats  also  contain  minor  components  such  as  tocopherols,  tocotrienols, sterols etc. The natural flavour of fats/oils is largely due to these minor components. Since most of the  minor components are antioxidants, they prevent fats from going rancid. Tocotrienols in palm oil, lignans in sesame oil and oryzanol and tocotrienols in rice-bran oil reduce blood cholesterol. Refining of oils, though does not alter their fatty acid composition, modifies the composition of minor components; for example, carotenes are lost during refining of crude palm oil.

Cholesterol : Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin such as milk, meat,  shrimp  and  prawn,  but  not  in  plant  foods.  Vegetable  oils  do  not  contain cholesterol. Egg yolk, and organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain contain very high amounts of cholesterol. Cholesterol is found in all body cells and plays a key role in the formation of brain, nerve tissue and is a pre-cursor for some hormones and vitamin D. It is synthesized in the body and hence it is not an essential dietary component.

Higher dietary cholesterol increases blood cholesterol. The blood cholesterolelevating effect of dietary saturated fats increases, when cholesterol consumption is high. Therefore, cholesterol intake should be maintained below 200 mg/day. One can reduce both saturated fat and cholesterol intake by limiting the consumption of high-fat animal foods like butter, ghee, meat, egg and organ meats and consuming low fat (skimmed) milk instead of whole milk. However, consumption of eggs (3eggs/ week) is recommended in view of several nutritional advantages.

## What are the physiological/health implications of different fats/fatty acids?

Saturated fatty acids are known to increase serum total and LDL-cholesterol levels, reduce insulin sensitivity and enhance thrombogenicity and increase CVD risk. Therefore, SFA intake should not exceed 8-10% of total energy. Skimmed milk should  be  preferred  instead  of  whole  milk.  Restrict  consumption  of  butter  and cheese. PUFAs are essential components of cell membranes. While n-6 PUFAs are predominant in all cells, the nerve tissue has high levels of long chain n-3 PUFA. An appropriate balance of the these two classes of PUFAs, namely, linoleic and -linolenic  acids  in  the  diets  is  essential  for  the  functioning  of  vascular,  immune, nervous and renal systems and for early human development. PUFAs particularly n3  PUFA  increase  insulin  sensitivity,  increase  peripheral  glucose  utilization  and decrease adiposity and hence are anti-atherogenic. n-6 PUFA decrease plasma alpha

cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol level (only at high intake). The lipid lowering and other physiological effects of individual  members  of  the  PUFAs  vary  widely. As compared   to   linoleic   acid, alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid is more beneficial for prevention  of  inflammation  and  accumulation  of  fatty  material  in  blood  vessels (altheroscleros) and clotting of blood (thrombosis). The long chain n-3 PUFA of fish oils  and  micro  algae  have  greater  antiatherogenic,  antithrombotic  and  antiinflammatory  effects  than  alpha-linolenic  (n-3)  acid  of  plant  foods.  They  are important for vision and brain growth. Therefore, pregnant women should consume foods that are rich in  ALA and long chain n-3 PUFA from fish and fish oils.

The intake of PUFA should be 8-10% of energy intake. The remaining 8-10% of fat calories can be derived from mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which also help in maintaining plasma cholesterol. Excessive use of highly unsaturated fats should be avoided. Further, to get a good proportion of all the classes of fatty acids, it is advisable to consume more than one type of vegetable oils.

Fats/  lipids  (triglycerides,  cholesterol  and  phospholipids)  are  transported  in blood in combination with proteins in the form of   'lipoproteins'. The low density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from liver to various tissues. High blood levels of LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol) result in accumulation of lipids in the cells  (atherogenic  effect).  High  density  lipoproteins  (HDL)  ('good'  cholesterol) transport excess cholesterol from the tissues to the liver for degradation, and are therefore, anti-atherogenic.

## Choice of cooking oils

In  view  of  the  above,  an  ideal  quality  fat  for  good  health  is  the  one  which maintains a balance, so as to give a  ratio  of  polyunsaturated/ saturated (PUFA/ SFA) of 0.8-1.0, and linoleic/ a -linolenic  (n-6/  n-3)  of  5-10  in  the  total  diet.  For ensuring this appropriate balance of fatty acids in cereal-based diets, it is necessary to increase the a -linolenic (n-3) acid intake and reduce  the quantity of linoleic (n-6) acid obtained from the cooking oil. Hence, the choice of cooking oil should be as follows:

<!-- image -->

Use of more than one source of fat/oil has the added advantage of providing a variety of minor components in the diet. An additional way of increasing alphalinolenic (n-3) acid intake is to ensure regular consumption of oils and foods rich in

alpha 6 &amp; eating fish, which provides preformed long chain n-3 PUFA. Ideally, part of visible fat and/or invisible fat from animal foods may be substituted by whole nuts and legumes with good proportion of -linolenic (n-3) acid, which are also good sources of protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals (ALA  content of foods is given in annexure 9). -linolenic  (n-3)  acid  (Table 7).  Non-vegetarians have an advantage of

The plant oils in addition contain certain useful substances such as lignans (sesame oil), sterols, tocopherols (vitamin E) oryzanole (rice bran oil), carotenoids all  of  which  reduce  cholesterol  and  reduce  oxidant  damage  due  to  ageing, inflamation which occur in chronic diseases.

## What about vanaspati ?

Vanaspati is  prepared  by  hydrogenation  of  vegetable  oils.  During  hydrogenation, the liquid oils become solid because the mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids are converted into saturated fatty acids and isomers called trans fatty acids. Vanaspati is used as a substitute for ghee in cooking and the preparation of bakery products, sweets and snack foods. Since, saturated fats are resistant to oxidation, foods  prepared  in vanaspati keep  fresh  for  a  longer  period.  Current  evidence indicates that saturated fatty acids and a high intake of trans fatty acids may increase the risk of heart disease. Therefore, it is essential to limit the intake of vanaspati . The intake of trans fatty acids should not exceed 1% of energy intake.

## Avoid  overeating  to  prevent  overweight  and  obesity

Rationale: O chronic non-communicable  diseases including heart disease, diabetes and certain types of cancers verweight/obesity  is  the  causative  factor  for  several

- /c190 A dramatic increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all the age groups has occurred in last 2-3 decades.
- /c190 About 30-50% of adult Indians are either overweight or obese.
- /c190 Overweight and obese individuals are at an enhanced risk of co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, gallstones, high blood cholesterol and  triglycerides,  orthopedic  disorders  (Osteoarthritis),  hypertension  and other cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers and psycho-social problems.
- /c190 The imbalance between the energy intake and energy out put leads to excess accumulation of fat in various parts of the body.

## What is desirable or ideal body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI)?

There is no clear definition of a desirable or ideal body weight. Body weight for a given height of person with good health and long lifespan is considered as Ideal body weight. A much simpler and more acceptable measure is the ratio of weight and height, which estimates total body mass and correlates highly with the % of body fat. The most commonly used ratio is the BMI. It is computed by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters [BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ 2 (Height M) ]. The ideal ranges of weights for a given height are provided by WHO (annexure 5), which is useful for categorizing persons as normal (ideal), undernourished and overweight or obese.

## What is obesity?

Definition of obesity is based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general accumulation, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered to be more  harmful  than  fat  around  the  hips.  Accumulation  of  fat  around  abdomen indicated by higher waist circumference is considered as risk factor. In general, BMI ranging  from  18.5  to  25  is  considered  to  be  normal.  However,  for Asians  it  is recommended that the BMI should be between 18.5 and 23, since, they tend to have higher  percentage  body  fat  even  at  lower  BMI  compared  to  Caucasians  and Europeans, which puts them at higher risk of chronic non-communicable diseases.

The  cut-off  levels  for  categorizing  overweight  and  obesity  in  children  and adolescents are different. th th =5  and &lt;85  centiles are normal, and th th th with =85  and &lt;95  centile are considered as overweight. More than 95  centile are considered as obese. Since, growth spurt in boys and girls occurs in different age groups, age and gender specific BMI centiles of reference population is used to th assess their nutritional  status. Thus,  children  with  BMI  less  than  5 centile  are considered as undernurished and those with

## Central obesity

The waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratios are useful for estimation of central and truncal obesity respectively. Several studies have shown that the central obesity  was  directly  correlated  with  chronic  degenerative  diseases  especially metabolic syndrome. Waist-to-hip ratio of more than 0.9 among men and 0.8 in women and waist circumference 90cm for men and 80cm for women are associated with  increased risk of several chronic diseases especially in  Asian Indians.

## Why should we avoid obesity?

There  are  several  health  consequences  of  obesity.  Excessive  body  weight increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, gallstones, certain types of cancers and osteoarthritis. Obesity invariably predisposes to reduced levels of high density lipoproteins ('good' cholesterol) and to increased levels of low density lipoproteins ('bad' cholesterol), and triglycerides, besides an abnormal increase in glucose  and  insulin  levels  in  blood.  Considering  the  increasing  trend  in  the prevalence of coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes in India, it is important to maintain desirable body weight for height and avoid obesity.

## What causes obesity ?

Over-feeding  during  infancy,  childhood  and  adolescence  predisposes  to overweight/ obesity during adulthood. The tendency of familial obesity seems to be inherited. Eating junk or unhealthy foods coupled  with  low  physical  activity  is considered as a main contributor. Complex behavioral and psychological factors influence the eating patterns. In addition, metabolic  errors  in  energy utilization  may  favor  fat  accumulation. Insulin is an important modifier of energy and fat metabolism favoring fat deposition.  Low  and  high  birth  weight

<!-- image -->

(&lt;2500 g and &gt;3500g), obesity during childhood and adolescence are likely to lead to obesity in adults. It is therefore, necessary to maintain a desirable body weight by consuming  just  enough  calories  or  adjust  physical  activity  to  maintain  energy balance (intake = output). Body weight must, therefore, be checked and monitored periodically.

Several  studies  have  suggested  that  hours  spent  in  watching  television  is strongly associated with weight gain in childhood and adolescents, mostly due to the sedentary behavior, tendency to consume snack foods while watching television and influence of the advertisements of energy dense foods.

Adults usually tend to gain weight between the ages of 25-50 years. In women, obesity develops just around pregnancy and after menopause.

## How to reduce body weight?

There is no single regimen for weight reduction; it has to be individualized. Weight reduction should be gradual. Weight reduction diets should not be less than 1000 Kcal/day and provide all nutrients. A reduction of half a kilogram body weight per week is considered to be safe. Extreme approaches should be avoided and use of drugs may be dangerous. In children, obesity should be controlled by increasing physical activity rather than restricting food intake. Modifications in dietary habits have to be incorporated into one's lifestyle along with adequate exercise to keep the body weight within the normal limits.

As fat contains more than twice the calories (9Kcal) per gram compared to protein (4Kcal) and carbohydrate (4Kcal), weight reducing diets should limit the fat intake.  Refined  sugars  (4Kcal)  and  alcohol  (7Kcal)  provide  empty  calories  and should  be  avoided.  Refined  carbohydrates  which  promote  fast  absorption  of glucose (Glycemic carbohydrates) also need to be restricted (Annexure 10). Plant foods  that  provide  complex  carbohydrates  and  fibre  may  be  preferred  as  they reduce blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Weight- reducing diets must be rich in proteins and low in carbohydrates and fats. Consumption of plenty of fruits and vegetables would not only result in satiety but could also help to maintain adequate  micronutrient  intake.  Frequent  fasting/  semi-fasting  (cyclic  weight reduction) followed by adequate or excess food consumption will also aggravate the problem of weight gain.  All reducing regimens should be monitored by a doctor and a dietitian.

## Guideline  9

## Exercise  regularly  and  be  physically  active  to  maintain ideal  body  weight

Rationale: Regular physical exercises increase strength and stamina, elevates 'good' cholesterol and adds pink tinge to health

- /c52 Physical activity of moderate intensity is recommended for health and wellbeing.
- /c52 Physical activity is essential to maintain ideal body weight by burning excess calories  and  is  of  vital  significance  for  health  and  prevention  of  noncommunicable diseases.

- /c52 Exercise is a prescriptive medicine.
- /c52 Move your body as much as you can.

<!-- image -->

## How much of physical exercise is needed?

It  is  recommended  to  carry  out  at  least  45  minutes  of  physical  activity  of moderate-intensity for at least 5 days in a week. This amount of physical activity may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. To lose weight, experts recommend that at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity be taken on most days of the week. In addition, one should follow a nutritious eating plan and consume fewer calories. Therefore, it is essential to remember that the body weight

is affected by the balance of 'calories-consumed' and 'calories-burned.' Those, who are on low calorie diets for body weight reduction should have moderate to vigorous intensity physical activities at least for 60-90 minutes daily. Physical activity is essential for successful long-term weight management and will depend on current BMI and health condition (Annexure 11).

## Levels of physical activity

There are two basic levels of physical activity .

This  includes  walking  briskly  (about  5-6  KM  in  an  hour),  climbing, gardening/yard  work,  dancing,  walking  short  distances  for  fetching  milk  and vegetables, bicycling (about 16 KM in an hour), and weight training (a general light workout), yogasanas and pranayama, playing with children. Moderate :

Examples are running/jogging (7 KM in an hour), cycling (&gt; 16 KM in an hour), swimming (freestyle laps), aerobics, brisk walking (6 KM in an hour), weight lifting (vigorous effort), competitive sports and heavy yard work, such as digging, cutting wood. Vigorous :

The  approximate  energy  costs  of  various  physical  activities  in  different intensities for a 60 kg person are given in annexure-11.

If  a  physical activity does not increase the heart rate, it is not intense enough to be counted in the category of '45 minutes of exercise a day'. Activities that do not increase the heart rate include walking at a casual pace, grocery shopping, and doing light household chores.

## Types of physical activities

These activities are very beneficial to health.

## Aerobic activities

These speed your heart rate  and  breathing  while  improving  heart  and  lung fitness. Examples: brisk walking, jogging and swimming.

## Resistance, strength building and weight-bearing activities

These help build and maintain bones and muscles by working them against gravity. Lifting weights, walking with child in arms are a few examples.

## Balance and stretching activities

Dancing, gentle stretching, yoga, martial arts and Tai chi reduce risk of injuries by improving physical stability and flexibility.

## Health Benefits of Physical Activity

Children and teenagers need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. In the case of pregnant women 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity  every  day  is  recommended.  However,  it  should  be  undertaken  in consultation  with  the  physician.  Like  others,  geriatric  population  also  will  be benefitted  considerably  by  physical  activity,  which  will  help  in  the  reduction  of functional impairment and improve lean body mass.

People with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, osteoporosis and obesity should consult physician before taking up the exercise program. Men over 40 and women over 50 should also consult doctor or health care provider before starting a vigorous physical activity program.

## Guideline  10 Restrict  salt  intake  to  minimum

Increased salt intake may pose health risk and may lead to

Rationale: hypertension and heart disease

- /c183 Sodium is the major electrolyte in the extra-cellular fluid.
- /c183 Sodium plays an important role in nerve conduction and fluid balance in the body.
- /c183 Maintenance of sodium balance depends on kidney function.
- /c183 High intake of salt (sodium chloride) is associated with high blood pressure and stomach cancer.
- /c183 All foods contain sodium. Sodium requirements can be met with moderate salt intake.
- /c183 Sodium intake needs to be balanced by potassium intake.

Salt  is  an  essential  ingredient  of  food  and  enhances  its  taste.  From  time immemorial, it has been used as a preservative.  All food substances contain sodium, but added salt (sodium 40%, chloride 60%) is the major source of sodium in our diet. Sodium is primarily involved in the maintenance of water balance and equilibrium. It also plays an important role in electro-physiological functions of the cell. Humans have powerful in-built mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure even on minimal sodium intake.

Sodium is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and a positive balance is  achieved  on  intakes  just  above  minimal  requirements.  Sodium  requirements depend  on  its  losses  through  urine,  faeces  and  sweat.  The  sweat  loss  varies according to climatic conditions. High ambient temperatures and vigorous physical exercise increase sodium loss through sweat. Even after 6 hours of hard physical labor, which may generate 3 litres of sweat, the requirement of sodium chloride may not be more than 6 g/day.

## Sources of sodium

Natural diets, in general, provide about 300-400 mg of sodium a day. Cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, animal and sea foods are the major sources of sodium. Indian data indicate that per capita consumption of salt ranges from less than 5g to 30g/day in different States with almost 40% of population consuming about 10g/day.

Since, the taste for salt is acquired, its consumption could be restricted right from an early age.

Preserved foods such as pickles, sun dried foods such as papads, sauces/ ketch up and canned foods contribute to higher intakes of salt.

## What are the health problems associated with excessive salt/sodium intake?

There  is  a  strong  association  between  salt  intake  and  blood  pressure. Prevalence of hypertension is low in populations consuming less than 3 g salt per day. The usual increase in blood pressure with age is also not seen with such intakes.  The  amount  of  salt  consumed  is  reflected  in  urinary  sodium.  Drastic restriction of dietary salt decreases the risk of hypertension. However, this effect is not uniform as only 20-30% of population is salt sensitive. Potassium-rich foods such as fresh vegetables and fruits decrease blood pressure. In fact, it is the ratio of sodium to potassium in the diet which is important. Salt intake higher than 8 g/day is considered as a risk factor for hypertension.

Besides increasing blood pressure, excessive salt may also affect stomach mucosa and result in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.

Higher sodium intake leads to greater calcium excretion which may result in reduction in bone density. Existing evidence reveals a deleterious impact of high salt intake on blood vessels, blood pressure, bones and gastrointestinal tract. Salt intake in our population generally exceeds the requirement. It should not be more than 6 g per day. Salt is used as a vehicle for food fortification since, it is commonly used in food preparation.

## Guideline  11

## Ensure  the  use  of  safe  and  clean  foods

Rationale: Contaminated and adulterated f are major causes for several food-borne illnesses in the country oods

- /c170 Safe and good-quality foods are  essential for maintaining good health
- /c170 Naturally-occurring toxins, environmental contaminants and adulterants in foods constitute a health hazard.
- /c170 Consumption of unsafe foods can lead to food-borne diseases.

## What makes food unsafe?

Microbes (bacteria and moulds) and their products are responsible for food spoilage. Natural enzymes present in food also lead to its deterioration. Besides, insects, rodents, adulterants, natural toxins and various chemical residues beyond permissible  levels,  make  the  food  unwholesome.  In  addition  to  moisture  and environmental conditions like temperature, storage time also influence the quality of the food.

## How do we select safe food?

Selection of the right food is the first step to ensure safe and good quality diet. Food items purchased from reliable sources having a high turnover ensure their freshness. Some foods carry certification mark assuring good quality. For example AGMARK for honey and ghee; FPO (Fruit Products Order) for fruit and vegetable products (jams, squashes, etc); ISI (Bureau of Indian Standards) for food colours and essences. While purchasing packaged food always look for 'best before' or 'date of expiry'.

Food  grains  purchased  should  be  free  from  infestation  and  foreign  matter (rodent excreta and insect remains). They should be of uniform size and should not be shrivelled, shrunken or mouldy. Foodstuffs should be free from artificial colors. There is a risk of adulteration when fats/oils are purchased loose from unsealed containers. Therefore, it is always safer to purchase reputed brand products in sealed sachets/containers. It is necessary to buy pasteurized milk in sachets from a reputed dairy or a reliable vendor to avoid the risk of adulteration and contamination. Milk products such as butter, ghee and khoa should also be purchased from reliable sources. Whole spices, uniform in color, size and shape should be preferred. Since powdered spices are more likely to be adulterated, always buy certified products. Fruits and vegetables that show patches, physical damage with bruises or wilted

and decayed with visible evidence of insects and moulds, should be avoided. Eggs should  be  fresh  and  free  from  cracks.  Meat  or  poultry  must  be  examined  for characteristic color, odor and texture and should be purchased fresh or frozen. Freshness of fresh-water fish is indicated by a stiff body, bright, clear and bulging eyes, reddish gills, tight scales and absence of stale odor or discoloration. Fresh fish will  not  show any pitting on finger pressure.

## What are the best practices of storage ?

Agricultural  commodities  should  be  dried  and adequately  in  a  safe  storage structure, to protect them from moisture and to prevent the damage from microbs like bacteria and mould producing toxins (eg. aflatoxins). Rodent attacks, and the presence of insects and microbes, not only reduce the availability of nutrients but render  the  foods  harmful.  Frequent  and  careful  disinfestation  of  the  storage premises using rodenticides like aluminium phosphide is essential. Some traditional household practices such as application of edible oils to grains, placing dried neem leaves in storage bins etc., are known to prevent infestations.

## Why do foodborne diseases occur?

Foodborne infections and toxicities are common particularly  with consumption of susceptible foods such as milk products like khoa , meat, poultry and even cooked foods like rice. Improper processing, handling and cooking, and keeping cooked foods in warm conditions for several hours before eating, promote bacterial growth and toxin production.

## How should perishable foods be handled ?

Perishable foods like milk, meat, vegetables and cooked foods, are prone to spoilage  due  to  microbes.  These  foods  should  be  stored  under  refrigeration, o preferably  at  a  temperature  of  10 c  or  less,  which  retards  multiplication  of microorganisms. However, even refrigerated foods, if stored for long, can get spoilt. Cross contamination can be avoided by keeping cooked and raw foods separately.

In case of food which is cooked, if not consumed immediately has to be stored for o some time, it should be kept either hot (more than 60 c) or be cooled quickly (below o o 10 c).  Most  micro-organisms  multiply  at  temperatures  between  10  and  60 c. Refrigerated  cooked  food  should  be  heated  before  consumption.  However, repeated heating may be avoided.

## What about personal hygiene ?

Food handlers should observe good personal hygiene to maintain food safety. They should be free from obvious signs of illness, wounds and sores. Traditionally in

India, cooked food is touched by bare hands while preparing, serving and eating. Use of spoons and ladles should be encouraged to avoid contamination. Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap before starting the preparation of food and after every interruption. Household pets like cats and dogs often harbour dangerous pathogens. They should be kept away from places where food is cooked, stored or served.

## What are the common adulterants?

Foods may be adulterated with non-food material or inferior quality product. Spoilt, stale or poor quality food is made attractive and fresh by adding harmful colors  or  other  chemicals.  Frequently  adulterated  food  items  are  milk  and  milk products, cereals, pulses and their products, edible oils and spices. The different classes of adulterants include non-permitted colors like metanil yellow; non-edible oils like castor oil; cheaper agricultural produce like various starches in milk powder; extraneous  matter  like  husk,  sand  and  sawdust;  and  metal  contaminants  like aluminum or iron filings. Consumption of adulterated foods could lead to disease outbreaks  of  epidemic  proportions.  Buying  from  a  reliable  and  reputed  source, careful checking of foods before purchase and insisting on certified brands will all minimize the risk of food adulteration.

## How to minimize effects of pesticide residues?

Pesticides,  used  during  cultivation  of  crops,  can remain as residues in foodstuffs, especially vegetables and  fruits.  Exposure  of  the  population  to  pesticide residues may be harmful and can be minimized by washing the foodstuffs thoroughly in running water or by peeling. Cooking and other processes can also  reduce  such  residues  (Annexure  12). Insect control operations such as disinfestation in the kitchen by spraying pesticides is another source of contamination. Utmost care should be taken to ensure that eatables are well covered and protected from exposure to such harmful agents.

## Guideline  12

## Adopt  right  pre-cooking  processes  and  appropriate cooking  methods

Rationale: Healthy and positive food concepts and cooking practices are foundation for good health

- /c167 Cultural factors play an important role in dietary practices.
- /c167 Faulty food fads and beliefs adversely affect nutrition and health.
- /c167 Cooking renders food palatable and helps in easy digestion.
- /c167 Cooking destroys harmful germs.
- /c167 Faulty pre-cooking and cooking process lead to loss of nutrients.
- /c167 Cooking at high temperatures leads to destruction of nutrients and formation of harmful substances.

## What are common Indian food beliefs, fads and taboos?

Food habits are formed early in childhood, passed on from the elders in the family and perpetuated to adulthood. Food beliefs either encourage or discourage the consumption of particular type of foods. There can be neutral, harmless or harmful practices. Unfortunately, most of the food fads and prejudices (taboos) are associated  with  women  and  children,  who  are  also  the  most  vulnerable  to malnutrition. Exaggerated beneficial or harmful claims in respect of some foods, without scientific basis constitute food fads. In addition, the belief of heat producing and cold inducing foods is widely prevalent. Some examples are jaggery, sugar, groundnuts, fried foods, mango, bajra, jowar, maize, eggs and meat. Papaya fruit is strongly suspected to lead to abortion, though there is no scientific basis. Buttermilk, curd, milk, green gram dhal, green leafy vegetables, ragi, barley flour and apples are considered as cold inducing foods which are actually nutritious. Vegetarianism is often practiced in India on religious grounds. Since vitamin B is present only in 12 foods of animal origin, vegetarians should ensure an adequate consumption of milk. During certain illnesses like measles and diarrhea, dietary restriction is practiced. This can aggravate malnutrition in young children.

## What are the effects of the pre-cooking processes?

Foods, in their  natural  state,  contain  different  nutrients  in  varying  amounts. Cooking  improves  the  digestibility  of  most  foods.  Flesh  foods  get  softened  on cooking and become easily chewable. Proper methods of cooking render foods

palatable by improving the appearance, taste, flavor and texture, thereby enhancing acceptability. In addition, they help in destroying disease causing organisms and eliminating  natural  inhibitors  of  digestion.  In  the  course  of  food  preparation, depending  on  the  recipe,  foods  are  subjected  to  various  processes  such  as washing, grinding, cutting, fermentation, germination and cooking. In the Indian cuisine, fermentation (idli, dosa, dhokla) and germination (sprouting) are common practices. These  methods  improve  digestibility  and  increase  nutrients  such  as B-complex vitamins and vitamin C.

## What are the effects of washing and cutting ?

Foods  should  be  washed  well  before  cooking  and  consumption  to  remove contaminants  like  pesticide  residues,  parasites  and  other  extraneous  material (Annexure 12). However, certain precautions need to be taken while washing and cutting to minimize the loss of nutrients. Repeated washing of food grains like rice and pulses results in losses of certain minerals and vitamins. Vegetables and fruits should  be  washed  thoroughly  with  potable  water  before  cutting.  Cutting  of vegetables in to small pieces exposes a greater surface area of the foodstuff to the atmosphere, resulting in loss of vitamins due to oxidation. Therefore, vegetables should be cut in to large pieces. Cut vegetables should not be soaked in water for long, as water-soluble minerals and vitamins get dissolved.

## What are the effects of cooking ?

There are many methods of cooking like boiling, steaming, pressure cooking, frying, roasting and baking. Boiling is the most common method of cooking, during which heat-labile and water-soluble vitamins like vitamin B-complex and C is lost. The practice of using excess water while cooking rice should be discouraged since it leads to loss of vitamins; just sufficient water to be fully absorbed should be used.

Use  of  baking  soda  for  hastening  cooking  of  pulses should  not  be  practiced,  as  it  results  in  loss  of vitamins. Frying involves cooking food in oil/ghee/ vanaspati at high temperatures. Shallow frying involves use of much  smaller amounts of oils than deep frying. Repeated  heating of oils particularly PUFA-rich oils results i n formation of peroxides  and  free  radicals and, hence, should be avoided

<!-- image -->

by using just enough oil. Similarly, oils which have been repeatedly heated should not be mixed with fresh oil but should be used for process such as seasoning.

## Microwave Cooking

Microwave cooking is convenient, fast and preserves nutrients and also useful in reheating of food. But it can reheat or cook unevenly and leave some cold spots in the food by which harmful bacteria can enter into our body. So it is discouraged to use large amounts or big pieces in the microwave oven otherwise mix the food in between for even heating or cooking. Never use partially heated food. Don't cook frozen food in the microwave oven directly as it leaves some parts of the food partially cooked.

Always use glass or pottery dishes and food grade microwave friendly plastic dishes and wrap to re-heat foods. Approximate calorific value of some cooked food preparation are given in annexure 8.

## Guideline  13

## Drink  plenty  of  water  and  take  beverages  in moderation

Rationale: Water is the most important nutrient of all and helps in the upkeep of our health

- Water is the major constituent of the human body. /c118
- /c118 Beverages are useful to relieve thirst and to meet fluid requirements of the body.
- /c118 Some beverages provide nutrients while others act as stimulants.
- /c118 Milk is  an  excellent  beverage for all age groups as it is a rich source of nutrients.

## Why do we need water?

Water accounts for 70% of our body weight. It is a constituent of blood and other vital body fluids. Water plays a key role in elimination of body wastes and regulation of body temperature. The body loses water through sweat, urine and faeces. This loss must be constantly made good with clean and potable water. A normal healthy person needs to drink about 8 glasses (2 litre) of water per day. During very hot weather and while undertaking vigorous physical activity, this requirement increases as a considerable amount of water is lost through sweat.

## When is water considered safe and wholesome ?

Water should be safe and wholesome i.e., it should be free from disease-causing agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites etc., and harmful chemical substances like pesticides, industrial wastes, heavy metals, nitrates, arsenic and excess of fluoride. Fluorosis,  a  disease  with  bone  deformities  and  dental  problems,  results  from drinking  water  containing  an  excess  of  fluoride  over  long  periods.  Generally,  a concentration of 0.5 to 0.8 mg of fluoride per litre of drinking water is considered safe.

## How is water rendered safe ?

If  a  water  source  is  not  safe  for  drinking,  boiling  it  for  10-15  minutes  is  a satisfactory method of purification of the water. It kills all disease-causing organisms and  also  removes  temporary  hardness.  However,  boiling  will  not  remove  other chemical impurities. Tablets containing 0.5g of chlorine can disinfect 20 litres of water. There are many modern gadgets which claim to provide safe and wholesome water. However,  they  vary  in  efficacy. Drinking water standards given in annexure-13.

## How nutritious is milk ?

Milk is a well accepted and wholesome food and beverage for all age groups. It contains  most  of  the  nutrients  necessary  for  growth  and  development.  It  is, therefore,  specially  useful  or  feeding  infants,  toddlers,  growing  children  and expectant  women  and  nursing  mothers. All  the  macro  and  micro-nutrients  are present in an easily digestible and assimilable form in milk. Milk proteins possess high biological value which is almost equal to that of meat, eggs and other highquality animal proteins. Milk proteins are valuable supplements to most vegetarian diets.

Milk is a rich source of bioavailable calcium which helps in the building up of strong bones. Milk fat serves as a vehicle for important fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E. Since, milk fat is of the saturated type those who have to be on a low fat diet can consume skimmed/toned milk. For strict vegetarians, milk is the only source of vitamin B . Milk is also rich in riboflavin, but is a poor source of vitamins C and iron. 12 However, only pasteurized or boiled milk should be consumed to ensure protection from disease-causing agents.

## What is lactose intolerance ?

Lactose, the sugar present in milk, helps in the establishment of lactic acid bacteria in the intestinal tract. If lactase, an enzyme required for digestion of lactose, is not present in sufficient amounts, such individuals develop abdominal symptoms on consumption of excess of milk. This is common in children following diarrhea and is described as lactose intolerance. Drinking small quantities of milk at a time does not usually cause any gastrointestinal problems and there is no need to discourage intake of milk by children except in severe cases of diarrhea.

## What are soft drinks ?

Soft drinks are generally of two categories, natural soft drinks and artificial or synthetic soft drinks. Water is the main constituent of all beverages. Orange, lemon, grape, mango, pineapple and apple are generally used in making fruit juice. sugar cane juice is also extensively used in India, particularly during summer. Natural fruit juices provide in addition to energy, some vitamins (beta-carotenes, vitamin C) and minerals  (potassium,  calcium).  Fruit  juices  being  potassium  rich  are  ideal beverages for those suffering from hypertension. However, they cannot be equated with fruits which also provide dietary fibre.

Compared to natural fruit juices, synthetic drinks do not contain nutrients unless they  are  fortified.  Generally,  synthetic  drinks  are  prepared  using  preservatives, artificial colors and flavors such as cola, orange, mango and lime, and mostly they

are carbonated. Carbonated beverages  contain phosphoric acid and may damage the enamel of teeth, and affect appetite if taken in excessive  amounts.  Water used for preparation of beverages should be free from  disease-causing  agents  and  harmful chemical impurities.

Beverages like buttermilk, lassi, fruit juices and coconut water are better alternatives to synthetic drinks.

## What about tea and coffee ?

Tea and coffee are popular beverages.

<!-- image -->

They  are  known  to  relieve  mental  and  muscular  fatigue.  This  characteristic stimulating effect is due to their caffeine content. A cup (150 ml) of brewed coffee contains 80-120 mg of caffeine and instant coffee 50-65 mg, while tea contains 3065 mg of caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and induces physiological dependence.

Generally, low doses (20-200 mg) of caffeine produce mild positive effects like a feeling of well-being, alertness and being energetic. Higher doses (&gt;200 mg) can produce negative effects like nervousness and anxiety, especially in people who do not usually consume caffeine-containing beverages. Therefore, moderation in tea and coffee consumption is advised so that caffeine intake does not exceed the tolerable limits. Tannin is also present in tea and coffee and is known to interfere with iron absorption. Hence, tea and coffee should be avoided at least for one hour before and after meals.

Excess consumption of coffee is known to increase blood pressure and cause abnormalities in heart beat. In addition, an association between coffee consumption and elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), triglycerides and heart disease has been demonstrated. Therefore, individuals with heart disease need to restrict coffee consumption. Also, those who experience adverse effects from caffeine should stop drinking coffee.

Besides caffeine, tea contains theobromine and theophylline. These are known to  relax  coronary  arteries  and  thereby  promote  circulation.  Tea  also  contains flavonoids and other antioxidant polyphenols, which are known to reduce the risk for coronary heart disease and stomach cancer. However, as a result of its caffeine content, excess tea consumption is deleterious to health. Decaffeinated coffee and tea are being marketed to obviate the adverse effects of caffeine.

## Tender coconut water

Tender coconut water is a nutritious beverage. It has a caloric value  of  17.4  per  100  gm.  The  concentration  of  sugar  steadily increases from 1.5% to about 5.5% in the early months of maturation and this slowly falls to about 2% at the stage of full maturity. Tender coconut water contains most of the minerals such as potassium  (290  mg%),  Sodium  (42  mg%),  Calcium  (44 mg%), magnesium (10 mg%), Phosphorus (9.2 mg%), iron  (106  mg%),and  copper  (26  mg%).  It  is  an  oral rehydration medium and keeps the body cool. However, in patients  with  hyper  kalemia  such  as  renal  failure,  acute

<!-- image -->

adrenal insufficiency and in patients with low urine output, TCW should be avoided.

## Alcohol

Alcoholic beverages contain ethyl alcohol in varying proportions. Beer contains 2-5% and wine 8-10% of alcohol, while brandy, rum and whisky contain much higher concentrations  (30-40%). Alcohol  has  been  extensively  abused  as  an  appetite stimulant and as a sedative-hypnotic drug. Alcohol intake, which is initiated as an innocent social habit may gradually result in a serious addiction. It may lead to several serious psycho-social problems and accidents.

Alcohol provides higher calories (7 Kcal/g) than carbohydrates and proteins and thus, can contribute to  obesity.  Ironically,  excessive  intake  of  alcohol  is known  to suppress appetite and interfere with absorption  and  metabolism  of  nutrients,  leading  to various nutritional deficiency diseases.

Excessive intake of alcohol suppresses appetite and as a result, leads to several nutritional deficiency diseases. People who regularly consume more than two  alcoholic  drinks  (one  equals  about  30  ml  of

<!-- image -->

ethanol) are at a higher risk for hypertension and stroke. Alcohol intake has also been shown to increase the risk of cancer of the mouth, larynx and oesophagus, prostate and of the breast in women. Excessive alcohol intake weakens the heart muscle  (cardiomyopathy)  and  also  damages  the  liver  (cirrhosis),  brain  and peripheral nerves. It also increases serum triglycerides.

## Guideline  14

## Minimize  the  use  of  processed  foods  rich  in  salt, sugar  and  fats

Rationale: Processed foods being rich in fats, salt, sugar and preservatives may pose a health risk if consumed regularly

- /c63 Urbanization has increased the intake and demand for processed foods.
- /c63 There is a trend towards replacing traditionally cooked foods with processed foods.
- /c63 Processed foods may not be nutritionally balanced unless fortified.
- /c63 Sugar, a processed food, provides empty calories.

## What are processed foods?

Foods that are subjected to technological modifications either for preservation or for converting into  ready-to-use/eat  foods,  eliminating  laborious household procedures, are called 'processed foods'. Some of the examples are ready mixes, dehydrated foods, pasta products, canned  foods, confectioneries,  bakery,  dairy  products and breakfast foods. Manufacture of processed foods requires technology application  and  machinery,  and  as  a result, processed foods are expensive.

## Do we need processed foods?

There is an increased demand for processed, ready-to-eat and convenience foods due to changes in lifestyle. As more and more women go to work outside, and families  have  become  nuclear,  consumption  of  processed  foods,  particularly  in urban areas, will be on the increase. Today's consumer is looking for convenient, easy-to-cook,  and  ready-to-eat  foods  which  require  less  time  to  prepare  than traditional  home-cooked  foods.  Food  processing  is  must  to  preserve  highly perishable  products  like  milk,  meat,  fish  and  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables.  Food processing  increases  the  seasonal  availability  of  foods  and  enables  easy transportation and distribution over long distances.

<!-- image -->

## Do processed foods contribute to nutrient intake?

Processed foods are generally consumed either as part of a meal, or as a snack item.  Their  contribution  in  terms  of  essential  nutrients  depends  on  the  type  of processing  and  fortification,  the  frequency  of  use,  and  the  quantity  consumed. Processed foods are generally refined and a majority of them are rich in fat or in salt/sugar, and are calorie dense. They lack dietary fibre and micronutrients. Thus, caution needs to be  exercised when processed foods constitute a major part of the meal.

Breakfast  cereals  are  increasingly  being  used  in  urban  areas.  Traditional breakfast items like idli, dosa, upma and roti are rich sources of nutrients. Puffed and parched rice products (eg. flaked rice) besides being crisp and tasty, are easily digestible. Food items like chips, candies, peppermints, chocolates, etc., which are popular  among  children,  are  considered  as  unhealthy  since,  they  provide  only empty calories often containing artificial colors and other additives. Their use should be discouraged.

## What is the difference between instant foods, fast foods, street foods and unhealthy (junk) foods?

## Instant foods

Instant foods are those, which undergo special processing designed to dissolve or to disperse particles more rapidly in a liquid than the untreated product. For instance, instant  noodles,  soup  powders,  cornflakes  fall  under  this  category. Although  all instant foods need not be unhealthy in terms of high calorie or salt contents, there are concerns about the presence of certain additives like monosodium glutamate, which may also add up to the over-all sodium intake from the foods.

## Fast Foods

Fast  foods  are  foods  already  made  or  cooked  to  order  within  minutes  for consumption like noodles, burgers, fried fish, milk shakes, chips, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, etc. Storage, handling and microbiological contamination are the major concerns. Further they are calorie dense foods.

## Street Foods

Street foods comprises of a wide range of ready-to-eat foods and beverages prepared and/or sold by vendors and hawkers, especially on streets and other public places. Idly, Wada, Dosa , Chat Items etc are examples of street foods. They may be contaminated with pathogenic organisms unless hygienically prepared.

## Unhealthy (Junk) Foods

Unhealthy foods are those containing little or no proteins, vitamins or minerals but are rich in salt, sugar, fats and are high in energy (calories). Some examples are chocolates, artificially flavored aerated drinks, potato chips, ice creams, french fries etc.

## Why should we restrict intake of unhealthy processed foods?

Frequent  consumption  of  unhealthy  processed  food  increases  calorie  intake without  providing  any  nutrients,  vitamins  and  minerals.  Apart  from  being  nonnutritious, processed foods also contain food additives. Food additives consumed beyond permissible limits may have adverse effects on health. The national food regulatory  authorities  periodically  review  these  limits.  Thus,  consumption  of processed foods may not only affect intake of nutrients, but in addition, increase the risk of exposure to various chemical additives.

In  the  coming  years,  with  larger  constraints  on  time  at  home,  demand  for processed foods is certain to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that intake of a nutritionally balanced diet is not compromised with unwise intake of various  processed  and  convenience  foods.  Processed  vegetables  and  fruits available in the market are no match to nutrient rich fresh vegetables and fruits.

## Why should we moderate intake of sugar ?

Sugars occur both naturally and as an ingredient in many foods. They are present in natural foods like fruits, vegetables, milk and honey. Added sugars provide taste and texture to foods. Sugar is present in processed foods like chocolates, jams, icecreams and soft drinks. The most familiar sugar is sucrose. Refined or table sugar (sucrose) provides 'empty calories'. Foods such as cakes, pastries, confectionery and sweets often have high amounts of fat, and sugar, and are prepared with refined cereals. Excess consumption of sugary foods may lead to obesity and elevated blood lipids. Children overindulging in chocolates and candies are prone to dental carries. For prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, sugars and refined cereals should be sparingly used.

## POINTS TO PONDER

- /c247 Elderly need more calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A and antioxidants to prevent age-related degenerative diseases and for healthy ageing.

## Who is an elderly person?

Individuals of 60 years and above (WHO) constitute the elderly. In India, the elderly constitute about 7 percent of the total population (Census, 2001) and by 2016 and by they are likely to increase to 10 percent.

## How are the elderly different?

Ageing affects almost all the systems of the body, and is associated with several physiological, metabolic and psychological changes. The changes incude decline in physical activity, digestion, metabolism, bone mass and muscle mass. Failing eye-sight and impaired hearing may also occur. Low appetite as a result of loss of taste and smell perception, dental problems, atrophic changes in GIT, constipation and decreased physical activity could lead to overall decrease of food intake and poor absorption of nutrients. Inability to prepare food, economic dependency and  other  psycho-social  problems  adversely  affects  the  health  and nutritional status of the elderly.

There is a decline in immune function with advancing age, which leads to decreased resistance to infectious diseases. The increased parathyroid

<!-- image -->

hormone  (PTH)  secretion  in  the  elderly  leads  to  increased  bone  turn  over  i.e. osteoporosis. Similarly, elderly individuals are at increased risk of osteomalacia i.e. defective bone mineralization due to lack of exposure to sunlight and poor diet.

## How can the elderly lead an active life?

In general, majority of the health problems among the elderly are nutrition related. Consumption of nutritious foods rich in micronutrients including antioxidant vitamins &amp; minerals and fibre, comfortable level of physical activity would enable the elderly to live active and meaningful healthy lives, without being a burden on society and their family members. Uncomplicated ageing can also be quite productive, say in the domestic sphere.

## What are the common diseases among the elderly?

Resistance to disease declines in the elderly. The common ailments in the elderly are degenerative  diseases  such  as  arthritis (joint diseases), osteoporosis, osteomalacia, cataract, diabetes, cardiovascular (stroke, heart diseases) problems, neurological  (Parkinson's,  Alzheimer's)  and  psychiatric  (dementia,  depression, delirium) disorders and cancer.  Besides these, the prevalence of respiratory, gastro intestinal tract (GIT) and urinary tract infections is common among the elderly.

## What type of diet should the elderly eat?

As  people  grow  older,  they  tend  to  become  physiologically  less  active  and therefore need fewer calories to maintain their weights. The daily intake of oil should not exceed 20 g. Use of ghee, butter, vanaspati and coconut oil should be avoided. They need foods rich in protein such as pulses, toned milk, egg-white etc. The elderly population is prone to various nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, the elderly need nutrient-rich foods rich in calcium, micro-nutrients and fibre.  Apart from cereals and pulses, they need daily at least 200-300 ml of milk and milk products and 400 g of vegetables and fruits to provide fibre, micro-nutrients and antioxidants. Inclusion of these items in the diet improves the quality of the diet and bowel function. Flesh foods and eggs add to the quality of diet (annexure 14 &amp; 15 ).

The diet needs to be well cooked, soft and less salty and spicy. Small quantities of food should be consumed at more frequent intervals and adequate water should be consumed to avoid dehydration, hyponatraemia and constipation.

## How can elderly remain fit and active ?

## Exercise and Physical Activity

Adults  over  the  age  of  20  years  should  undertake  a  minimum  of  30-45  minutes  of physical activity of moderate intensity (such as brisk walking 5-6 km/hr) 5-6 days of the week. Greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in physical activity of longer duration or more vigorous intensity such as jogging, running, cycling and swimming.

Sedentary people embarking on a physical activity programme should undertake a moderate intensity activity of short duration to start with and gradually increase the duration or intensity. Other day-to-day activities like walking, housework, gardening, will be beneficial not only in weight reduction but also for lowering of blood pressure and serum triglycerides. It also  elevates  HDL  (good)  cholesterol  in  blood.  Simple  modification  in  lifestyle  like deliberately climbing up the stairs instead of using the lift and walking for short distance instead of using a vehicle could also immensely help in increasing our physical activity.

Exercise program should include 'warm up' and 'cool down' periods each lasting for 5 minutes. During exercise, the intensity of exercise should ensure 60-70% increase in heart rate.

Inactive men over the age of 40 years, women over the age of 50 years and people at high risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes should first consult a physician before engaging in a program of vigorous physical activity such as running and swimming.

Forty five minutes per day of moderate intensity physical activity provides many health benefits. However, even greater health benefits can be gained through more vigorous  exercise  or  by  staying  active  for  a  longer  time.  This  also  burns  more calories. Regardless of the activity being selected, one can do it all at once or divide it  into  two  or  three  parts  during  the  day.

## Removal of the Pesticide Residues from the Food Products by Different Methods

Most  of  the  pesticide  residues  can  be  removed  by  adopting  four  methods. These methods should be easily adopted at the house hold level to remove the pesticide residues. These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.

## Washing

The first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is washing. About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing. Washing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that normally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.

The pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, plums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require 2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The pesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal processing such as washing, blanching and cooking.

## Blanching

Blanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the vegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching. But before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and fruits.

## Peeling

Contact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be removed by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from the raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net influence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed food.

## Cooking

## Animal Products

Animal  products  are  also  the  major  source  of  contamination  for  pesticide residues in human diets since the animals feed on fodder, which are sprayed with pesticides.   Pressure cooking, frying and baking will minimize the harmful effect pesticide residues.

## Dairy products

Boiling  of  milk  at  high  temperatures  will  destroy  the  persistent  pesticide residues.

## Vegetable Oils

Refined oils will have fewer amounts of pesticide residues.  Household heating of oils will  minimize pesticide residues.

## Glossary

Allergic  reaction :  Immunologically  induced  tissue  response  to  a  foreign  substance (allergen).

Alpha-linolenic acid : 18 carbon fatty acid with three double bonds; the first double bond is on the third carbon atom from the methyl end and therefore it is called n-3 fatty acid.  It is abbreviated as 18: 3 n-3.

Amino acid :  The  fundamental building block of proteins.

Anabolism : Process by which complex materials in tissues and organs are built up from simple substances.

Antioxidants :  A group of substances that prevent the damage caused by the oxidation of fatty acids and proteins by oxygen free radicals.

Atherosclerosis :   Gradual deposition of fatty materials and fibrous tissues in the inner lining of the arteries with eventual obstruction of blood flow.

Balanced Diet : A  diet  containing  all  essential  (macro  and  micro)  nutrients  in  optimum quantities and in appropriate proportions that meet the requirements.

Beta-Carotene : A yellow - orange plant pigment which yields vitamin A by oxidation in the body.

Bifidus factor :  A substance in human milk which stimulates the growth of a micro-organism ( Lactobacillus bifidus )  in  the  infants'  intestine.

Body Mass Index :   Body weight in relation to height. Body weight in kilograms divided by 2 height in metres .

Calorie :   Unit used to indicate the energy value of foods. Quantitative requirements are expressed in terms of energy, i.e., kilocalories (Kcals). Newer unit for energy is Kjoules.

Catabolism :  Process of breakdown of complex organic constituents in the body.

Cataract :   An  opacity  of  the  lens  of  the  eye  resulting  in  impaired  vision.

Cholesterol : A  lipid  constituent of blood and tissues derived from diet as well as from synthesis within the body.

Cirrhosis :  Inflammation and scarring of liver tissues resulting in impaired liver function.

Colostrum :   The milk produced by mammals during the first few days after delivery.

Congenital anomalies :  Deformities existing at birth or even before.

Coronary heart disease :  A disease of the heart due to inadequate blood supply as a result of narrowing/obstruction of coronary arteries which nourish heart muscle.

CU : Consumption Unit. One unit represents Recommended Dietary Allowance of energy for a sedentary man.

Diabetes mellitus :  A disease in which the blood glucose is increased and the body tissues cannot use glucose properly.

Diverticular disease :   The presence of many pouches or sac-like protrusions on the wall of the intestine.

Empty calories :  T erm  used for foods that provide only energy without any other nutrient, eg. white sugar and alcohol.

Enzymes :  Biological  catalysts which enhance the rate of chemical reactions in the body.

Essential fatty acids (EFA) : Fatty acids like linoleic acid and alpha linolenic acid which are not made in the human body and must be supplied through the diet.

Fatty acids :  Fundamental constitutents of many lipids.

Fibre :   Collective term for the structural parts of plant tissues which are resistant to the human digestive enzymes.

Flavonoids :  Pigments widely distributed in nature in flowers, fruits and vegetables.

Food Exchange :   Foods are classified into different groups for exchange.  Each 'exchange list' includes a number of measured foods of similar nutritive value that can be substituted inter-changeably in meal plans.

Free radicals :   Highly reactive oxygen-derived species formed in the body during normal metabolic processes.  They have the capacity to damage cellular components by oxidation.

Haemorrhoids :  Commonly known as piles.

High-density  lipoproteins  (HDL) :  These  transport  cholesterol  from  the  extra-hepatic tissues to the liver.  They are anti-atherogenic.

Hormones :  Substances produced by a gland (endocrine) which are secreted directly into the blood stream to produce a specific effect on another organ.

Hyperlipidemia :  An  increase  in  the  concentration  of  blood  lipids  (triglycerides  and cholesterol).

Invisible fats : Fat present as an integral component of plant and animal foods such as in cereals, legumes and spices.

Ischaemia :  Lack of blood supply to an organ or tissue resulting in reduced oxygen supply, caused either by constriction or obstruction of the blood vessel.

Lactoferrin :  Minor  protein  of  milk  containing iron.

Lactose  intolerance :  Disorder  resulting  from  improper  digestion  of  milk  sugar  called lactose, due to lack of an enzyme, lactase, in the intestinal mucosa.

Linoleic acid : Fatty acid containing 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds.   The first double bond is on the sixth carbon atom from the methyl end.  Therefore it is called n-6 fatty acid and is abbreviated as 18:2 n-6.

Lipids :  A  technical  term  for  fats.    They  are  important  dietary  constituents.  The  group includes triglycerides, steroids, cholesterol and other complex lipids.

Lipoproteins : Lipids are not soluble in blood; they are therefore transported as lipid and protein complexes.

Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) :  These transport cholesterol from the liver to tissues. High blood levels indicate that more cholesterol is being transported to tissues.

Macrocytic anaemia : Anaemia characterized by red blood cells which are larger than normal.

Macronutrients : Nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats which are required in large quantities.

Metabolism :  Includes  catabolism and anabolism.

Microcytic anaemia : Anaemia characterized by red blood cells which are smaller than normal.

Micronutrients :  Nutrients which are required in small quantities, such as vitamins and trace elements.

Monounsaturated fatty acids :  Unsaturated fatty acids with one double bond.

n-6 PUFA : Linoleic acid and its longer chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are collectively called n-6 PUFA.

n-3  PUFA :  Alpha-linolenic  acid  and  its  longer-chain  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  are collectively called n-3 PUFA.

Osteoporosis :  A  condition  of  abnormal porousness or thinning of bones.

Phytochemicals :  General name for chemicals present in plants.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) : Unsaturated fatty acids with two or more double bonds.

Processed foods : Foods that are produced by converting raw food materials into a form suitable for eating.

Pre-eclampsia : A toxemic condition of late pregnancy characterized by increased blood pressure, swelling of feet and excretion of protein in the urine.

Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) :  A  marked  dietary  deficiency  of  both  energy  and protein resulting in undernutrition.

Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) : The amounts of dietary energy and nutrients considered sufficient for maintaining good health by the people of a country.

Refined foods : Foods which have been processed to improve their appearance, colour, taste, odour or keeping quality.

Saturated fatty acids :   Fatty acids containing maximum number of hydrogen atoms that each carbon atom can carry. They do not have double bonds.

Satiety :  Feeling  of  satisfaction  after  food  intake.

Stroke : Popular term for cerebro-vascular disease, a sudden condition that arises from blocking or bleeding of blood vessels in the brain, resulting in paralysis.

Thrombosis :  The condition in which the blood changes from a liquid to a semi-solid state and produces a blood clot (thrombus) which blocks blood flow.

Trans -fatty acids : Are mainly produced during hydrogenation of oils; a few also occur naturally in very small quantities.

Triglycerides (Neutral fat) :   The major type of dietary fat and the principal form in which energy is stored in the body.  A complex of fatty acids and glycerol.

Unsaturated fatty acids :  Fatty acids in which there is a shortage of hydrogen atoms.  The carbon atoms then become linked by double bonds.  Unsaturated fatty acids are less stable than saturated fatty acids.

Visible fats : Fats and oils that can be used directly or in cooking.

Weaning foods : Foods which are used during gradual transition of the infant from breastfeeding to a normal diet.
