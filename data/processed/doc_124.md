## SOONERCARE DOCUMENT VERIFICATION GUIDE

## How to use this guide :

- First, in the left column, find the verification request that matches the request on your member portal or letter. Read the brief description to understand the request.
- Second, in the middle column, view what ideal documents can be turned in for the verification request. Only one document is needed unless otherwise stated.
- Some verification requests may require that you call the SoonerCare helpline.
- Please provide the documents by the date in the notice you received from SoonerCare. Do not send originals, they will not be returned.

Any document turned in may be marked as 'document not accepted' if it is not readable, password protected, cannot be used to update the requested verification, or is not related to the verification request, etc. If this happens, you will need to upload a new document for your eligibility to be reviewed.

Some income types do not count towards determining your eligibility. Examples include child support, food stamps, VA disability, foster care/adoption payments, TANF payments, workers' compensation, etc.  If these income types are listed on your case and you have received an income verification for unearned income, contact the SoonerCare helpline at 800-987-7767 for assistance.
