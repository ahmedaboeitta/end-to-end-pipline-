## Protect your pregnancy from Listeria

## Listeria is a harmful germ that can be in some food.

## Listeria illness is rare.

Every year, 4 in 100,000 pregnant women in the U.S. get sick with Listeria .

## But it can harm your baby.

Sadly, 1 in 4 pregnant women who get this illness lose their pregnancy or their baby shortly after birth. That's because the germ can spread to your baby and harm them while you are pregnant, even if you don't feel very sick.

Choose safer food options. See the next page for foods not to eat and foods to choose instead.

Check for recalled foods contaminated with Listeria : www.foodsafety.gov/recalls-and-outbreaks

Call your healthcare provider right away if you have a fever and feel more tired and achy than normal. Let them know if you ate a recalled food in the past two months or are worried about something you ate. (This is because Listeria illness can sometimes start many weeks later.) Early treatment can help save your baby.

## Choose safer foods to protect your pregnancy from Listeria

Listeria is a harmful germ that can be in food. It can cause pregnancy loss or hurt your baby. The good news is that you can choose safer food options to protect your baby during your pregnancy.

## Quick guide to safer food options

Listeria can grow at cold temperatures in refrigerators, but it is easily killed by heat. In general, foods that are safer include:

Cooked or reheated foods that reach a high enough temperature for germs to be killed. (You can let the food cool before eating.)

Shelf-stable foods are heated or dried to kill germs that can cause illness or spoil food. They are in sealed cans, jars, or pouches that do not need to be refrigerated until opened.

Pasteurized foods are heated to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill germs.
