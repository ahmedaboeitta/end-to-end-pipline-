Pregnancy  and  childbirth  are  normal  physiological  processes  for  women  of  reproductive age. However, they carry underlying risk factors that can endanger the lives of mothers, such as  anaemia,  pregnancy-induced  hypertension,  antepartum  and  postpartum  haemorrhage, sepsis, and other direct and indirect causes of maternal deaths. In 2017, the estimated number of  maternal  deaths  worldwide  was  295,000  and  the  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR)  was  211 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Most maternal deaths are preventable if timely access to appropriate healthcare services are ensured, and yet we continue to struggle to save the lives of these mothers.

Target 3.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) calls for the global maternal mortality ratio to be reduced to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, with no country having MMR greater than 140 per 100,000 live births. Nepal is also committed to achieving this goal and has made maternal health one of its top development priorities. Recently, the Ministry of Health and Population and the National Statistics Office, in collaboration with the Nepal Health Research Council and health development partners (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, USAID/SSBH, British Embassy Kathmandu/NHSSP, GIZ), carried out the Nepal Maternal Mortality Study 2021 to determine the current status and causes of maternal deaths in the country. It was conducted following the National Population and Housing Census using the verbal autopsy method in order to obtain an accurate estimate of Nepal's maternal mortality  situation.  This  report  presents  the  latest  information  on  the  MMR,  pregnancy-related mortality ratio, causes of death, and other related estimates at the federal, provincial, and local levels. We are confident that the results of this study will shed light and provide fresh information that will help us review our current policies on maternal health, formulate new strategies for further improvement, and achieve target 3.1 of the SDG.

We believe that this study report will be a landmark document that will help us better comprehend the maternal mortality situation in the country. We would like to affirm that the Ministry of Health and Population is  committed to translating  the  available  evidence  into  policy  actions  for  the advancement of maternal health in Nepal.

## fOReWORD

The National Population and Housing Census 2021: A Report on Maternal Mortality is the first ever integrated national effort by the Government of Nepal to estimate the country's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and its causes. By providing an accurate estimation of the country's MMR, it provides an important step towards meeting target 3.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): reducing the global MMR to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

Previous studies and surveys have indicated an improvement in Nepal's MMR, but the country lacked  a  recent  and  comprehensive  study  on  maternal  mortality.  This  study  was,  therefore, undertaken with the aim of analyzing the current situation in Nepal and to get insights on the underlying causes of maternal mortality at the federal, provincial, and local levels by using the verbal autopsy method.

It has been my privilege to lead this study's steering committee, which involved members from the  Population  Management  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Population,  the  National Statistics Office, the Nepal Health Research Council, and health development partners, all of whom provided valuable input and support. I acknowledge the efforts taken by former chairpersons of Steering Committee, chairs and members of the technical committee and all those who directly or indirectly contributed to successful accomplishment of the study.

The  study  involved  rigorous  survey  design,  training,  fieldwork,  data  processing,  and  analysis. Despite the multiple challenges in the field, the study team was able to capture quality data. I am confident that the key findings that it presents are accurate. This report provides a comprehensive look at the levels of and differentials in maternal health parameters and gives a close analysis of the periods, places, and causes of death, and the status of antenatal care. It has also tried to identify the types of delays that occurred during the process of childbirth that led to pregnancyrelated mortality.

The information presented in this report will provide crucial data and evidence for the evaluation of  the  existing  national  maternal  health  program,  and  will  help  to  identify  and  address implementation gaps. It will guide policymakers as well as organizations at the federal, provincial, and local levels in determining the future strategic directions for identifying and implementing tailored interventions to improve maternal health outcomes and achieve the SDG target.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) and the National Statistics Office (NSO) are  pleased  to  present  the  Nepal  Maternal Mortality  Study  (NMMS)  2021,  which  was conducted following the National Population and Housing Census 2021. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the  NSO  was  successful  in  completing  the census, the first since the country transitioned to a federal system. The Census 2021 provides  comprehensive  information  on  the demographic,  social,  economic,  and  spatial characteristics of the population.

The National Population and Housing Census has  the  ability  to  capture  data  of  all  deaths of  women  of  reproductive  age  across  the country.  Birth  and  death  information  have been the major contents of all such previous censuses.  In  the  National  Population  and Housing Census 2021, the twelfth in the series, the MoHP, in collaboration with the NSO, made a historical arrangement to verify the deaths of  women  of  reproductive  age  reported  by the Census 2021 enumerators, conduct verbal autopsy  to  estimate  the  maternal  mortality ratio (MMR) at  the federal, provincial, and local levels,  and  analyse  the  causes  of  maternal deaths.

The  NMMS  2021  is  a  special  and  unique undertaking. It has provided MMR estimates along with causes of death, which will allow the  MoHP,  development partners, and other stakeholders  to  review  the  current  health policy and strategies, and design interventions to address the causes of death.  We  are privileged and honoured to set a cornerstone in Nepal's statistical history. All the institutions and  staff  who  were  engaged  in  the  study deserve special thanks and appreciation.

Firstly,  the  MoHP  would like  to  thank  all  the respondents of the study and their families for their support. The consent of the families was essential  in  making  this  study  possible.  We also extend our sincere condolences to those who  have  lost  loved  ones  to  issues  related to pregnancy and childbirth. Their losses will not be in vain - the information that we have gathered through this study will help us work towards  preventing  similar  tragedies  in  the future.

Secondly, we would like to thank the members  of  the  NMMS  2021  Steering  and Technical  Committees  for  their  contribution to  the  successful  completion  of  the  study. Our appreciation goes to Dr. Hem Raj Regmi, Joint  Secretary,  NSO  and  Dr.  Bibek  Kumar Lal,  Director  of  the  Family  Welfare  Division of  the  Department of Health Services of the MoHP  for  entrusting  the  responsibility  to the  committees.  Mr.  Kapil  Prasad Timalsena, Under-Secretary of the Population Management  Division  (PMD)  of  the  MoHP and  Mr.  Dhundi  Raj  Lamichhane,  Director, NSO,  deserve  praise  for  their  leadership  in coordinating  and  executing  the  study. In addition,  we  would like  to  acknowledge the contributions  of  Mr.  Keshab  Kumar  Gautam, Director, NSO; Dr. Suresh Mehata, Senior Pubic  Health  Administrator,  Province  1;  Mr Binod Paudel, Statistics  Officer,  PMD,  and  Dr Meghnath  Dhimal,  Chief,  Research  Section, Nepal Health Research Council, and the team; Mr.  Dol  Narayan  Shrestha,  Computer  Officer, NSO,  Mr.  Pradeep  Poudel,  Strategic  Advisor, NHSSP  and  Mr.  Paban  Kumar  Ghimire,  NPO, WHO for their tireless efforts - right from the conceptualisation of the study to its successful completion.

We  are extremely grateful to our health development partners -WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, USAID,  British  Embassy  Kathmandu/NHSSP, and  GIZ  -  for  their  technical  and  financial support for  the  NMMS  2021. We  would  also like to express our gratitude to ADRA Nepal, Kamana  Health  Nepal,  and  Mitra  Samaj  for their invaluable support in managing various trainings  and  executing  verbal  autopsy  and data  entry.  We  thank  USAID/SSBH  for  their generous  support in the maternal death assignment,  in  coordination  with  the  MoHP . We  would  also  like  to  thank  national  and international reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions which helped to improve the quality of the report.

This study would be incomplete without the hard  work  of  the  health  workers  across  the country  -  they  made  tremendous  efforts to  conduct  the  verbal  autopsy  of  maternal deaths.

This study will be a key step towards Nepal's endeavor to achieve the Sustainable Development  Goal  of  reducing  MMR  to  70 maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births  by 2030.

We  believe this report will contribute in improving  maternal  health  by  supporting evidence-based  policy  decisions,  planning, and monitoring in Nepal.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARy

The Sustainable Development Goals include the  target  of  reducing  the  global  maternal mortality  ratio  (MMR)  to  less  than  70  per 100,000  live  births,  with  no  country  having an MMR  that exceeds twice the global average.  Nepal  has  committed  to  reduce the MMR from 281 per 100,000 live births in 2006 to 116 by 2022, 99 by 2025, and 70 by 2030.  This  Nepal  Maternal  Mortality  Study 2021 is the first ever joint undertaking of the Ministry  of  Health  and  Population  (MoHP), the National Statistics Office (NSO), the Nepal  Health  Research  Council,  and  health development  partners  for  estimating  the MMR and identifying the causes of maternal deaths  -  during  pregnancy,  delivery,  and postpartum periods - in Nepal. By doing so, it  intends to inform evidence-based policies and programs at the federal, provincial, and local levels.

The      MoHP ,  in      collaboration      with      the NSO, made an arrangement through a Memorandum of Understanding, where the census enumerators, as a part of their regular work, collected data on live births and deaths of  women  of  reproductive  age  (WRA)  in the  enumerated  households  for  the  last  12 months  preceding  the  National  Population and Housing Census 2021. In the first phase, those  Census  enumerators  then  completed the death notification forms to identify pregnancy-related deaths, and submitted them to the census supervisor and notified the deaths to the pre-identified and trained local  level  health  workers.  In  the  second phase  of  the  study,  the  local  level  health workers visited the household of each of the deceased  women,  verified  the  information and identified the pregnancy related deaths. For each pregnancy-related death identified, a  verbal  autopsy  was  conducted  by  trained health workers using the verbal autopsy form.

The MMR was found to be 151 per 100,000 live  births  in  Nepal,  with  higher  ratios  in the Lumbini and Karnali provinces (207 and 172 per 100,000 live births respectively) and  a  lowest  ratio  in  the  Bagmati  province (98  per  100,000  live  births).  Of  the  12,976 deaths  among  women  of  reproductive  age (15-49  years),  653  were  pregnancy-related, comprising five percent of the total deaths in this age group.

Of the 653 pregnancy-related deaths, 622 (95 percent) were classified as maternal deaths. The  overall  proportion  of  maternal  deaths among the deaths of women of reproductive age  was  4.8  percent.  Only  611  maternal deaths were  analysed further for causes and other attributes due to lack of sufficient information for 11 maternal deaths.

The majority of the maternal deaths occurred in the postpartum period (61 percent), while  thirty-three  percent  occurred  during pregnancy  and  six  percent  during  delivery. Nearly  half  of  the  deaths  (47  percent)  were reported in the Lumbini and Madhesh provinces.  One  in  ten  maternal  deaths  was among  adolescent  mothers.  The  majority of the deaths (57 percent) occurred in health facilities, whereas 26 percent occurred at home.

Out of 412 women who died during delivery and  post-partum  period,  fifty-three  percent had  attended  all  four  antenatal  care  visits; while of the 173 women who died between 7-42 days of delivery 45 percent had attended all three postnatal care visits as per the protocol.

Among  the  women  who  had  died  during delivery and in the postpartum period, over three-fourth  (76  percent)  had  delivered  at

health facilities. Among those, 62 percent had delivered  at  government  facilities  while  38 percent at non- government health facility.

Twenty-seven  percent  of  women  who  died during the postpartum period had excessive bleeding, 23 percent had experienced dizziness  and  fainting,  and  12  percent  had been  afflicted  by  fits  and  seizures.  Eightythree  percent  of  the  deceased  had  sought treatment  for  illness  at  a  health  facility  or other place before death. Among those who did  not  seek  treatment,  nearly  half  did  not consider it necessary (48%).

The  largest  cause  of  maternal  death  was found to be non-obstetric complications (indirect  maternal  deaths)  (32  percent).  This was  followed  by  obstetric  haemorrhage  (26 percent) and hypertensive disorders (12 percent).  Five  percent  of  the  deaths  were attributable to pregnancies  with abortive outcomes. The leading causes of death during pregnancy were observed to   be non-obstetric complications (40 percent), followed by direct deaths without obstetric codes (17 percent), and hypertensive disorders (14 percent). On the  other  hand,  more  than  three  quarters (78  percent)  of  deaths  during  delivery  were attributable  to  obstetric  haemorrhage.  For deaths during the postpartum period, nearly a  third  were  due  to  obstetric  haemorrhage and non- obstetric complications (31 percent each).

In connection to the 'Three Delays' that lead to  pregnancy-related  mortality,  a  majority (74  percent)  of  the  deceased  women  had experienced at least one type of delay, while 17 percent had experienced all three delays. The most common was the delay in seeking appropriate care (57 percent), followed by  delay  in  receiving  appropriate  care  (40 percent), and delay in reaching the healthcare facility for care (33 percent).

In conclusion, the study showed that many  maternal  deaths  in  Nepal  are  due  to preventable causes such as haemorrhage and high blood pressure during pregnancy, but a significant  number  are  also  caused  by  nonobstetric  complications  such  as  intentional self-harm.  It  highlighted  the  importance  of improving  the  quality  of  maternal  health services in health facilities and strengthening referral mechanisms, emergency transportation, and early screening for danger  signs.  In  addition  of  its  potential  to strengthen community-based maternal death surveillance  and  response  in  the  country, the  NMMS  2021  also  sets  a  precedent  for conducting nationwide censuses of maternal deaths  in  future  censuses  to  estimate  the MMR and identify causes of death.

## INTRODUCTION 1 C H A P T E R

## 1.1. Background

Reducing  maternal  mortality  is  one  of  the priority targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The global target is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births.  This target aims to reduce the MMR of all countries by at least two-thirds from the 2010 baseline, with  no  country  having  MMR  higher  than 140  deaths  per  100,000  live  births  by  2030 (SDG 3.7.1).

Nepal has committed to reducing its MMR from 281 per 100,000 live births in 2006 to 116 by 2022, 99 by 2025, and 70 by 2030 1 . Therefore, it is crucial to monitor maternal deaths, identify their causes and determinants, and implement tailored interventions to achieve the target of SDG  3.7.1.  Contextualising  the  efforts  at  the federal, provincial, and local levels is necessary to achieve this target.

In  Nepal,  various  methods  are  employed  to estimate the MMR through surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey and Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Studies, among others. These  surveys  capture  maternal  deaths  to estimate the MMR. In addition, the Pregnancyrelated Mortality Ratio (PRMR) has often been used as a proxy for MMR. However, this year, for the first time, the Nepal Maternal Mortality Study  2021  (NMMS  2021)  was  conducted  to estimate the MMR following the Census 2021. This is a significant milestone in understanding the MMR in the country.

The NMMS 2021 is a joint effort of the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), the National Statistics Office (NSO) (former Central Bureau of Statistics),  the  Nepal  Health  Research  Council

(NHRC), and health development  partners (HDPs). The MoHP signed a Memorandum of Understanding  with  the  NSO  to  include  this study as part of the Census 2021.

The Census 2021 collected information on several health indicators, particularly demography, fertility, mortality, and disability. Its main questionnaire allows estimation of  the  PRMR,  but  does  not  provide  MMR (unless  the  questions  on  the  cause  of  death due  to  accidents  or  violence  are  taken  into account).  Additionally,  the  census  does  not offer information on medical causes of death. In  Nepal,  where  Civil  Registration  and  Vital Statistics capacity is limited and exact data on causes of death is difficult to retrieve, this study uses the Verbal Autopsy (VA) method based on the  pregnancy-related  deaths  identified  and reported by the Census 2021 enumerators.

Therefore,  the  NMMS  2021  captured  data  on all  pregnancy-related  deaths  during  the  12 months preceding the Census 2021. It provides federal and provincial level MMR estimates for the first time in Nepal and generates detailed information  on  causes  of  death  and  other morbid conditions of the deceased women.

All  levels  of  government  in  the  country  have a  shared  responsibility  for  the  health  of  the population,  so  it  is  important  to  estimate MMR at the federal, provincial, and local levels. This  allows  for  the  exploration  of  the  causes of  death  and  the  formulation  of  evidenceinformed policies  and  targeted  interventions. In  addition,  this  study  helps  to  improve  the overall quality of mortality and morbidity data in the census, which can be used to estimate the burden of disease and develop life tables.

| Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)                            | Globally, the demographic and health surveys estimate MMR using the direct sisterhoodmethod. 2 TheNepalDemographicandHealthSurvey(NDHS)generates the estimates of MMR in every alternate round. The NDHS 1996, 2006, and 2016 generated the estimates of PRMR (but referred to as MMR in reports until the NDHS 2016). The NDHS 2016 was the first in its series to give MMRestimates (239 per 100,000 live births) based on the maternal deaths. The NDHS is not designed to provide the causes of maternal deaths. Given the small number of maternal deaths captured in the various NDHSs, its MMRestimates are not available at sub- national levels. |
| Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Studies (MMMS)                       | Nepal has so far performed two Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Studies (MMMS) - in 1998 and 2008/09. The MMMS1998was carried out in three districts (Okhaldhunga, Rupandehi and Kailali), but it did not collect information on live birthsand,therefore,didnotgenerateMMRestimates.TheMMMS2008/09covered eight districts (Okhaldhunga, Sunsari, Baglung, Rupandehi, Banke, Surkhet, Jumla and Kailali), and estimated the MMRtobe229 per 100,000 live births.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response System (MPDSR) | Under the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) system, the community-based maternal death surveillance and response system is currently being implemented in 27 districts and the hospital-based maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response system in 94 hospitals across the country. Even though a significant number of maternal deaths are reported from these sites, the data are not representative enough to calculate MMRfor the country.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| united Nations (uN) estimates                                         | In an effort to measure maternal mortality in countries lacking vital registration, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF and the United Nations Population Division, as part of the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG), provide country-specific MMR estimates based on 'modeling' using available national empirical data on maternal deaths in a country and covariates. These initiatives generate the estimates at the national level, but do not deal with the causes of maternal deaths.                                                                                                                                         |
| National Population and Housing Census (NPHC)                         | The National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) has been conducted at 10- year intervals since 1911. Its12 th series wascarried out in 2021.The NPHCgenerally collects health-related information on fertility, births, and age standardised mortality in broader categories. The 11 th NPHC in 2011, for the first time, had produced the national estimates of PRMR (480 per 100,000 live births) but did not examine the causes of maternal deaths.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## 1.3 Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to estimate the MMR at  the federal, provincial, and local levels and identify programmatically useful information to inform investment and interventions directed towards the improvement of maternal health in Nepal. Its specific purposes are:

- n To identify the causes of death during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.
- n To guide the evidence-based policies, strategies, and implementation plans at  the federal, provincial, and local levels to develop targeted interventions that are successful in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in the local context.

## 2.1. Study design

The  NMMS  2021  was  led  by  the  Population Management  Division  (PMD)  of  the  MoHP in  collaboration  with  the  NSO.  A  steering committee chaired by the Additional Health Secretary of the MoHP and members comprising from the MoHP, NSO, and the HDPs provided  oversight  to  the  study.  Similarly,  a technical working committee chaired by the Chief  of  the  PMD  and  members  comprising from the MoHP, NSO, Family Welfare Division (FWD),  NHRC,  and  the  HDPs  was  formed  to provide  technical  input  and  ensure  quality. Likewise, seven provincial and 77 district-level technical  committees  were  formed  for  the effective implementation of the study at the respective  levels.  The  composition  of  these committees is presented in Annex 1.

The NHRC and the HDPs provided guidance in the design and implementation of the study. The NHRC provided technical guidance, while the HDPs-WHO,  UNICEF, UNFPA, British Embassy Kathmandu/Nepal Health Sector Support Programme (BEK/NHSSP), USAID, and  GIZ-provided  technical  and  financial assistance.

The NMMS 2021 is a retrospective study based on  the  women  of  reproductive  age  (WRA) and  pregnancy-related  deaths  reported  by the  Census  2021.  The  data  for  the  census was  collected  in  two  phases.  The  first  was completed between 30 Bhadra and 18 Ashoj 2078 (15 September to 4 October 2021) and the second between 25 Kartik and 9 Mangsir 2078  (11  to  25  November  2021).  The  data collection included the data of all the deaths that were reported to have taken place in the

<!-- image -->

12  months  (defined  as  a  reference  period) preceding the Census 2021. This study, thus, also  includes  all  pregnancy-related  deaths reported in the census. The VA started from  26  Kartik  2078  (12  November  2021) and was completed by 30 Mangsir 2078 (16 December 2021).

## 2.2 Study tools

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) guided the  implementation  of  the  NMMS  2021.  It included the tools, procedures, methodology, operational definitions, and work plan for the study. The NMMS 2021 used four tools, which are briefly described in this section and also included in Annex 2.

## 2.2.1 Census questionnaire

The  main  questionnaire  of  the  Census  2021 served as the primary tool for the identification of pregnancy-related deaths and live births. It identified  households  that  had  experienced deaths of family members (de facto population) in the 12 months preceding the census.  In  such  cases,  the  census  collected detailed information on the deaths, including the  full  name,  sex,  and  age  of  the  deceased person, and main cause of death as reported by the respondent. Additionally, in the case of WRA deaths, the census collected details on the pregnancy status of the deceased women. The section of the Census 2021 questionnaire on death-related information is presented in Annex 2.1.

The Census 2021 questionnaire collected data on live births in the 12 months preceding the Census 2021. This provided the denominator for the calculation of PRMR and MMR.

## 2.2.2 WRA death notification form

The Census 2021 questionnaire included questions to categorise the  WRA  deaths by  the  pregnancy  status  of  the  deceased: during  pregnancy,  delivery,  or  postpartum period  (within  six  weeks  after  childbirth)  or beyond  (none  of  these  periods/not  related to pregnancy). All WRA deaths - irrespective of  the  period  of  pregnancy  at  the  time  of death -  reported under Sub-section 6 of    Question  15  (Annex  2.1)  of  the  Census 2021  served  as  the main  source  for the identification of pregnancy-related deaths for this study. A notification form was developed to  record  all  the  deaths  reported  under  the aforementioned  sub-section  (Annex  2.2).  It included the following information: name of the  deceased  woman, contact details  of  the household  head,  stage  of  pregnancy  at  the time of death, i.e., during pregnancy, during delivery, during abortion or death after delivery/abortion  up  to  42  days,  or  others (beyond/not related to pregnancy). The Census  2021  supervisors  and  enumerators were  trained  on  completing  the  notification form  and  its  reporting  channels.  This  study did not include late maternal deaths - those that occurred after 42 days till one year after delivery.

## 2.2.3. Mobile application for notifying WRA deaths

A  mobile  application  (for  both  Android  and iOS  platforms)  was  developed  to  notify  preidentified  and  trained  health  workers  about WRA  deaths.  The  Census  2021  enumerators notified the health workers in their respective enumeration areas, and were provided with  their  phone  numbers  for  this  purpose. The  enumerators  and  health  workers  were oriented on the application prior to its use.

and federal levels used this data to track VA completions  for  the  identified  pregnancyrelated deaths.

## 2.2.4. Verbal autopsy form

The VA tool of the national MPDSR program, managed by the FWD of the Department of Health Services of the MoHP, was customised and used for the NMMS 2021. It aligned with the  protocols  for  pregnancy  and  postnatal care. The tool was translated into the Nepali language, pretested, and finalised. In addition, a  VA  manual  was  prepared  and  provided to  all  the  trained  health  workers  to  ensure uniformity in data collection (Annex 2.3).

## 2.2.5 Cause of death assignment form

A form was developed  to assign causes of death  to  all  pregnancy-related  deaths, in accordance with WHO's International Classification  of  Disease-Maternal  Mortality (ICD-MM) 3  codes (Annex 2.4).

## 2.3 training/orientation

A cascade of training sessions was organised for implementation of the NMMS 2021.

## 2.3.1 Orientation to the census 2021 trainers and enumerators

The  MoHP,  in  collaboration  with  the  NSO, oriented  the  Census  2021  trainers  at  the federal, provincial, and local levels on identifying  and  notifying  WRA  deaths.  The trainers  and  enumerators  were  familiarised with the overall process of the study and their specific roles at the respective level.

## 2.3.2 Master training of trainers (Mtot) at the federal level

After  receiving  the  detailed  data  as  per  the death  notification  forms,  the  health  workers uploaded the information and VA status of the pregnancy-related deaths to the application. Then, the study team at the district, provincial,

Officials from the MoHP , NHRC, FWD, Provincial Health Ministry/Health Directorate, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, NHSSP, GIZ, and independent gynecologists/obstetricians  were  trained  as master trainers for this study. A two-day MToT was organised in Kathmandu on 4 and 5 Ashoj 2078 (20 and 21 September 2021).

## 2.3.3 training of trainers (tot) at the provincial level

A two-day ToT was organised in each of the seven provinces between 8 and 15 Ashoj 2078 (24  September  to  1  October  2021).  At  least two health officials with nursing background and experience of maternal health from each of the 77 districts were trained as trainers for  the  VA  executors.  The  ToT  participants served  as  the  district  coordinators  for  the NMMS 2021.

## 2.3.4 Health worker training

A  total  of  854  health  workers  were  trained to  conduct  VA  at  the  local  levels  (Table  2). A  two-  day  training  was  organised  at  the district level from  13  Ashoj  to 15 Kartik 2078  (29  September  to  1  November  2021), in  which  participants  from  the  MToT  and ToT  trained  the  health  workers. The  number of  participants  from  each  local  level  was determined based on the type of local level and  the  population.  One  participant  was selected  from  each  rural  municipality  and municipalities  with  population  of  less  than 50,000, while two participants were selected from  municipalities  with  more  than  50,000 population.  There were  three participants from  each  sub-metropolitan  city  and  four from metropolitan cities.

## 2.3.5 Logistic support to the trainings

UNFPA, UNICEF, NHSSP, and GIZ jointly supported  the  consortium  of  ADRA  Nepal, Mitra Samaj, and Kamana  Health in the management  of  the  MToT  and  ToT  events. Likewise, USAID through Kamana Health supported the management of the VA training events.

USAID,  through  the  Strengthening  Systems for Better Health (SSBH) Activity, and UNICEF supported  the  recruitment  of  the  reviewers for assigning the cause of death.

## 2.4 ethical review

Prior  to  execution  of  the  study,  the  NMMS 2021 study protocol was reviewed and approved (Reg No. 674/2021P) by the Ethical Review Board (ERB) of the NHRC.

## 2.5 Pretest of study tools

The  Death  Notification  Form  and  the  VA questionnaire were pre-tested in Thali, Kageswari Manohara Municipality in Kathmandu District in coordination with the  District  Health  Office.  The  pre-test  of the  questionnaire  was  carried  out  by  the core  study  team  members  from  the  MoHP and  NHRC.  This  was  done  to  ensure:  the appropriateness of the language, the ability of the respondents to recall the information and

respond properly, the comprehensiveness of the questionnaire, the time taken to complete the interview, and the overall interview technique. The  tools  were  revised  based  on the findings of the pre-test.

## 2.6 field work

The field work comprised of identification of live  births,  WRA  deaths,  pregnancy-related deaths, and VA.

## 2.6.1 Identification of live births

The  Census  2021  enumerators  identified  all live  births  in  the  enumerated  households  in the  12  months  preceding  the  Census  2021. The live birth data was provided by the NSO to the MoHP to estimate the MMR and PRMR.

## 2.6.2 Identification and verification of WRA and pregnancy-related deaths

The  Census  2021  enumerators  completed the Death Notification Forms to identify WRA deaths in the enumerated households in the 12 months preceding the Census 2021. Mobile text  messages  -  with  the  words  'Female Death Found' - were sent by the enumerators to  the  pre-identified  trained  health  workers in  their  enumeration  area,  while  the  Census 2021  supervisors  too  were  informed  about the deaths. Then, the health workers communicated with the enumerators for the contact  details  of  the  relevant  households. Next, the health workers, in consultation with  and/or  accompanied  by  local  Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), visited the households, identified appropriate respondents, and verified information about the deaths. The health workers used screening questions  to  determine  whether  the  deaths had occurred during pregnancy, delivery,  or postpartum period up to 42 days.

The Death Notification Forms and the list of WRA deaths were handed over to the MoHP by the NSO.

## 2.6.3 Verbal autopsy (VA)

After each pregnancy-related death was verified, the trained health workers identified appropriate  respondents  in  the  household and  interviewed  them  using  VA  forms.  The completed  VA  forms  were  collected  at  the (district) health office, and reviewed by the  district  coordinators  for  completeness, consistency,  and  overall  quality.  Incomplete VA forms were returned to the health worker who had executed the VA. The VA forms were then sent to the provincial health directorate and finally to the MoHP .

## 2.7 Cause of death assignment

Each  VA  form  was  reviewed  independently by two reviewers (gynecologist/obstetrician), who then assigned the cause of death using the  ICD-MM guideline. After this, the results were  compared.  If  there  were  differences,  a third  reviewer  independently  reviewed  and assigned the cause of death using the ICD-MM code. In such cases, the final cause of death was  asserted  with  majority  rule,  where  the cause assigned by at least two reviewers was considered  as  the  final  cause  of  death.  Out of  653 VA forms, 134 cases were decided by the majority rule. In 38 cases where all three reviewers did not agree with a common cause, a  panel  of  experts  identified  by  the  NMMS 2021 Technical Working Committee reviewed and  assigned  the  final  cause  of  death.  The reviewers also recorded the level of certainty in  each  assigned  cause.  They  recorded  the causal sequence, from the underlying causes to the final cause of death, as recommended by WHO.

The  flow  chart  presents  the  process  and steps  of  the  NMMS  2021.  It  starts  with  the identification  of  live  births  and WRA  deaths, implementation  of  VA,  assignment  of  cause of  death,  data  analysis,  and  ends  with  the finalisation of the report.

## 2.8 Quality assurance

A mechanism was developed to assure quality at each step of the study. A steering committee at the federal level, and a technical working committee at the federal, provincial, and district levels were formed to steer, coordinate, oversee, and guarantee the quality of the study. An evaluation checklist was prepared for census officers and district coordinators  to  monitor  visits  during  the collection  of  census  data.  The  district  and provincial coordinators closely  supervised the  quality  of  training  and  data  collection, with  a  special  focus  on  ensuring  that  no WRA deaths were missed for reporting in the Census 2021.

The completed VA questionnaires were reviewed in each province by the provinciallevel coordinators under the direct supervision  of  the  MoHP  and  NHRC.  Prior to data entry, the completed VA forms were analysed  by  the  study  coordinators  at  the MoHP. Incomplete forms were returned to the district coordinators for further clarification, completeness, and consistency. Case  verifications  were  carried  out  through phone  calls  and  by  mobilising  local-level health workers and FCHVs.

## 2.9 Data management and analysis

The  completed  VA  forms  and  the  cause  of death assignment forms were entered into a database developed in the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) software. A double entry  procedure  was  followed  to  minimise errors. After the completion of data entry, the data from CSPro was converted into the Stata 17 software for analysis. This involved the use of descriptive analysis and the calculation of frequency distribution and percentage, while data was visualised in figures and diagrams.

The Census 2021 reported a total of 12,976 WRA  deaths,  of  which  653  were  identified as  pregnancy-related.  Verbal  autopsy  was carried out for each of these cases.  However, the information collected in the VA form for 11 of these deaths were incomplete due to the unavailability  of  appropriate  respondent(s). Although  information  on  the  background characteristics  and  conditions  surrounding these  cases  were  missing,  the  study  team could  gather  enough  information  -  such as period of death, cause, and conditions at the  time  of  death  -  from  the  respondents contacted  (relatives  and  neighbors  of  the deceased  women)  to  determine  them  as maternal deaths.

| Number ofWRAdeaths reported by the Census                 |   12976 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Number of pregnancy related deaths reported by the Census |     653 |
| Number of verbal autopsies completed                      |     653 |
| Number of pregnancy-related deaths for estimation of PRMR |     653 |
| Number of pregnancy-related deaths for analysis           |     642 |
| Number of maternal deaths for estimation ofMMR            |     622 |
| Number of maternal deaths for analysis                    |     611 |
| Number of coincidental deaths                             |      31 |
| Number of live births reported by the Census              |  412935 |

The NMMS 2021 records a total of 622 maternal deaths for MMR estimation. Nonetheless, due to the limited information, the 11 cases lacked the information for assigning a specific cause of  death  based  on  the  ICD-MM  guideline. Consequently,  these  11  deaths  have  been excluded  from  the  analysis  except  in  MMR estimation (Table 3).

Given that this study used the data generated by  the  Census  2021,  absolute  figures  have been used for analysis throughout this report.

## 2.10 Limitations of the study

The  primary  tool  for  the  NMMS  2021  was verbal  autopsy.  The  causes  of  death  were assigned based on the information collected using the VA form, and not from the clinical reports.  Therefore, the general limitations of  VA  methodology,  such  as  recall  bias  and social  desirability  bias,  among  others,  apply to this study as well. The VA executors could not find appropriate respondents to interview for 11 pregnancy-related deaths reported by the  Census  2021  enumerators.  Some  of  the cases  were  reported  to  have  died  in  India and  the  deceased  women's  caretakers  were unavailable for interviews at the time of this study. Few respondents also deliberately refused to respond  to specific questions, particularly those related to the background characteristics  of  the  deceased  women  and their causes of death. This was specific to those who died in case of premarital pregnancy.

## 2.11 Operational definition of the key terms

Verbal  autopsy: Verbal  autopsy  (VA)  is  a method of ascertaining the clinical causes of death in a defined population by interviewing those closest to the deceased at the time of death  (relatives,  friends,  neighbors)  about symptoms, signs, and the circumstances preceding death.

Pregnancy: Period  from  the  first  day  of  last menstrual  period  before  the  onset  of  true labour.

Delivery: Period from the onset of true labour till the expulsion / delivery of the placenta.

Postpartum period: Period up to 42 days of birth of the child.

abortion: Expulsion or extraction of the product of conception before 24 weeks. Includes self-expulsion as well as use of medicines/instruments  to  expel  the  product of conception.

Spontaneous abortion: Termination of pregnancy  by  expulsion  of  the  product  of conception  before  24  weeks  of  gestation, without any intervention.

Induced abortion: Termination of pregnancy by voluntary expulsion/extraction of the product of conception using medicines/ instruments etc.

Live birth: Complete  expulsion/extraction from  its  mother  the  product  of  conception showing  some  signs  of  life  irrespective  of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows  any other evidence of life.

Pregnancy-related death: Death of a woman  while  pregnant  or  within  42  days of  termination  of  pregnancy,  irrespective  of cause of death.

Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant  or  within  42  days  of  termination of  pregnancy,  irrespective  of  the  duration and  site  of  the  pregnancy,  from  any  cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its  management  but  not  from  accidental  or incidental causes.

Direct maternal death: Deaths resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnancy state (pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period) from interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.

Indirect  maternal  death: Deaths  resulting from preexisting disease or disease that developed during pregnancy that was not due to direct obstetric causes, but was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.

Place of usual residence: A person is considered  a  usual  resident  of  a  specified location/place only if s/he 'had been living or intends to live there for the last six months.' A  person  who  is  absent  from  his/her  usual residence for a short period-for the purpose of treatment,  pilgrimage,  or other  similar reasons-is treated as present. Persons away or absent from their birthplace or usual residence for employment, study, or business are considered absent and thus, not counted as  part  of  the  present  population.  However, for this study, the homeless or mobile population were counted at the place where they were traced.

## KEy FINDINGS 3 C H A P T E R

This chapter presents the findings regarding the status of maternal and pregnancy-related deaths  in  Nepal.  It  presents  the  causes  of deaths by background characteristics of the deceased women, morbidities as well as delays  in  seeking,  reaching,  and  receiving care.

## 3.1 Pregnancy-related deaths

- n A  total  of  653  pregnancy-related  deaths were reported during the reference period.  The  distribution  is  presented  by province and age group.
- n Among the seven provinces, the highest number  of  deaths  were  reported  from Lumbini (25 percent), followed by Madhesh  (22  percent),  while  the  seven percent  of  deaths  were  reported  from Gandaki (Figure 1).
- n Nearly one-third of the deaths were in the age group of 20 to 24 years (30 percent), while 10 percent of the deaths had occurred among adolescents (Figure 2).

## Causes of pregnancy-related deaths

- n This  data  includes  all  deaths  that  were reported during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum periods up to 42 days due to any cause. It excludes 11 deaths that could not be assigned causes due to incomplete information.
- n Among the pregnancy-related deaths (N= 642), a major contribution was from non-obstetric complications  (31 percent), followed by obstetric haemorrhage (25  percent),  hypertensive  disorders  in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (11 percent), and pregnancy-related infection (seven percent) (Figure 3).
- n Five percent of deaths were due to coincidental  causes,  among  which  the most common causes were trauma, electrocution, and snake/insect bites (Annex 3.6).

## 3.2 Maternal deaths

- n Out of the 653 pregnancy-related deaths, 622 were identified as maternal. This section  provides  a  detailed  analysis  on 611  maternal  deaths  (excluding  11  from the  622  maternal  deaths),  which  were categorised  in  three  periods:  pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum.
- n The majority of maternal deaths (61 percent) were observed in the postpartum period (within 42 days of delivery), while the lowest number of deaths (six percent) occurred during delivery (Table 4).

## 3.2.1 Background characteristics of the deceased women

- n Three-quarters  of  the  deceased  women were  in  the  age  group  of  20-34  years. Ten percent of deaths were among adolescents, with a majority (57 percent) occurring in the postpartum period (Table 4).
- n A high proportion of maternal deaths (38 percent)  was  observed  among  women

4. 11 deaths with incomplete information were excluded

- who had no formal schooling as compared to  women  with  bachelors  and  above education (six percent).
- n Among  the  provinces,  Lumbini  reported the  highest  number  of  maternal  deaths (25  percent),  followed  by  Madhesh  (22 percent).  On  the  other  hand,  relatively lower  number  of  deaths  were  reported from  Karnali  (nine  percent)  and  Gandaki (seven percent) provinces.
- n The  Terai  region,  which  has  a  relatively dense  population,  observed  more  than half  of  the  maternal  deaths  (55  percent). This was followed by the hill (39 percent) and mountain (six percent) regions.
- n The numbers of deaths were almost similar in the rural municipalities  and municipalities.
- n The  maternal  deaths  were  almost  equal during  pregnancy  in  all  the  ecological belts. However, a higher percentage of deaths during the delivery period (19 percent) was reported in the mountainous region.

## 3.2.5 abortion and complications

## type and time of abortion

- n Thirty-seven (six percent) of the 611 maternal  death  had  spontaneous or induced abortion, for the index pregnancy.  However, not all those maternal  deaths  were  related  to abortive outcomes.  Two out of five deceased women who had an abortion, had an induced abortion (Figure 7).

## Method  and  place  of  induced abortion

- n Among  the  15  women  who  had induced abortion, 80 percent reported to have used medical abortion drugs (Figure 8).
- n One-third of them had the procedures at private hospitals and  an  equal  number  at  home (Figure 9).

## type of abortion by period

Percent

- n A  majority  (60  percent)  of  the deceased  women  had  induced abortion during the first trimester and 33 percent during the second trimester (Figure 10).
- n Nearly  two-third  of  the  women with spontaneous  abortion  (65 percent) had it during the second trimester.

## abortion-related complications

- n The  most  common  complications during or after an abortion among the deceased women were: bleeding (68 percent), severe abdominal  pain  (46  percent),  and fever (43 percent)(Figure 11). Percent

## time of death

- n Among  the  deaths  to  abortionrelated complications, over 80 percent  occurred  within  42  days of  the  post-abortion  period,  and 16 percent during abortion (Figure 12).

## 3.2.8 Health service utilisation

## antenatal care (aNC)

- n Among the women who died during pregnancy, delivery or postpartum period (611), 85 percent had at least one ANC visit for the index pregnancy (Figure 17).
- n Among the women who died during delivery and postpartum period (412), only 53 percent had attended all four ANC visits, which is recommended by the safe motherhood service protocol. As per the previous protocol, first ANC visit occurred in the 4th month (12-16 weeks of gestation), second in the 6th month (20-24 weeks of gestation), third in the 8th month (2832 weeks of gestation), and the fourth in the 9th month (36-40 weeks of gestation)*.

## Health service utilisation

- n Eighty-three percent of the deceased women had sought treatment at a health facility or other places for the complications they had experienced before death (Table 10).
- n Thirty-six  percent  had  visited  private  hospitals  for  treatment  before  death,  followed  by government hospitals (35 percent) and basic health service centers (13 percent).
- n Approximately 74 percent had received treatment from doctors for their last illness or health problem before death.

## Reasons for not seeking health care

- n Seeking health services was considered unnecessary by nearly half of the deceased women.
- n Other reasons included: lack of knowledge (17 percent), distance to health facility (12 percent), and lack of transportation (16 percent) (Figure 19).

## 3.2.9 Delays antecedent to death

- n With regards to the 'Three Delays' model, a majority (74 percent) of the deceased women had experienced at least one type of delay, while 17 percent had experienced all three delays. The most common was the delay in seeking care (first delay - 57 percent), followed by delay in receiving care (third delay - 40 percent), and delay in reaching the facility for care (second delay - 33 percent) (Table 11).
- n Twenty-six percent of the deceased women did not experience any delay antecedent to their death (Figure 20).

## Delays in the community

- n The most common causes of the first delay were identifying the health problem (41 percent), decision to seek care (38 percent), practice of traditional norms (17 percent), and treatment by people other than skilled health workers (17 percent) (Figure 21).
- n Once the decision was made to seek care, there were delays in reaching the health facilities due to difficulties in arranging finances (20 percent), delays in arranging transportation (18 percent), absence of companions for travelling to the health facilities (12 percent), unable to receive permission from home (11 percent), and inability to travel at night (seven percent).

## Delays in the health facility

- n The most common reasons for delays at health facilities were identifying risks for timely referral from the referring facilities (24 percent), administrative delays in the referred facilities (17 percent), arranging  transportation  from  the  referring  health  facilities  to  reach  the  referred  facilities  (12 percent), and inadequate communication between health facilities (11 percent) (Figure 22).
- n The respondents also reported delays in receiving treatment after admission (14 percent), lack of essential equipment (11 percent), shortfall of trained health workers (nine percent), delays in blood arranging (nine percent), and shortage of medicines (seven percent).

## 3.2.10 Classification of causes of maternal deaths

- n Among the causes of deaths assigned to maternal deaths (N=611), 68 percent were direct, and 32 percent were due to non-obstetric complications (indirect maternal deaths) (Table 12).
- n The leading direct cause of maternal deaths was obstetric haemorrhage (26 percent). Among the deaths attributed to obstetric haemorrhage, the majority (92 percent) had postpartum haemorrhage and eight percent had antepartum haemorrhage.
- n The second leading direct cause of maternal death was hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (12 percent).
- n Six percent of the women had died due to other obstetric complications.
- n Likewise, six percent of the women were reported to have died due to intentional self-harm, which has been coded as a direct maternal death without an obstetric code. Most of these deaths occurred during pregnancy.
- n Seven percent of the women had died due to pregnancy-related infection mostly during the postpartum period, five percent due to pregnancy with abortive outcomes, and one percent due to unanticipated complications related to anesthesia.
- n The causes of maternal deaths by province are given in Annex 3.4.

## 3.3 Levels of mortality

## 3.3.1 Levels of pregnancy-related mortality

- n Five  percent  of  the  deaths  of  women  of  reproductive  age  (15-49  years)  were  pregnancyrelated (Table 13). There were variations in pregnancy-related deaths among provinces, with 3 percent in the Bagmati Province and 9 percent in the Karnali Province.
- n The overall ratio of pregnancy-related deaths is 158 per 100,000 live births. This ranged from 102 per 100,000 live births  in  Bagmati  Province  to  212  per  100,000  live  births  in  Lumbini Province.

## 3.3.2: Levels of maternal mortality

- n Maternal deaths accounted for five percent of all the deaths among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) (Table 14). The percentage contribution ranges from 3 percent in Bagmati Province to 8 percent in Karnali Province.
- n The maternal mortality ratio is 151 per 100,000 live births in Nepal. This ranges from 98 per 100,000 live births in Bagmati Province to 207 per 100,000 live births in Lumbini Province.
- n The proportion of deaths that are maternal among the deaths of women of reproductive age varied by reproductive age group (Table 15). Maternal deaths comprised a higher proportion of deaths to WRA in their twenties.

## CONCLUSION 4 C H A P T E R

The Nepal Maternal Mortality Study (NMMS) following the National Population and Housing  Census  2021  is  a  landmark,  joint initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Health and  Population  and  the  National  Statistics Office  to  estimate  maternal  mortality  ratios (MMR) at the federal and provincial levels and set the ground for the MMR estimation at local levels. More importantly, this study identifies the  causes  and  locations  of  maternal  death in  Nepal.  This  study  is  notable  for  its  large population coverage, rigorous methodology, and stakeholder collaboration.

The study estimated the MMR of the country at 151 per 100,000 live births. This calculation was  done  using  the  Census  data  on  live births  and  maternal  deaths.  The  study  also uncovered inequalities in MMR  between different provinces in the country. For example, Lumbini and Karnali provinces had higher  MMRs  of  207  and  172,  respectively, while Bagmati province had the lowest MMR at  98  per  100,000  live  births.  Similarly,  the pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 158 per 100,000 live births.

The study has found that many maternal deaths in  Nepal  are  due  to  preventable  causes  such as  haemorrhage  and  hypertensive  disorders during pregnancy. However, a significant number  of  deaths  are  also  caused  by  nonobstetric  complications,  such  as  intentional self-harm.

The  NMMS  2021  serves  as  an  initiative  to strengthen community-based maternal death surveillance and response in the country. For instance, in this study, local-level health workers were trained in screening for pregnancy-related deaths and conducting verbal autopsies (collecting information about  the  circumstances  of  death  through

interviews  with  family  members  and  other sources) to determine the cause of death. This approach played a crucial role in identifying and responding to maternal deaths. Moreover, collecting  this  information  and  using  it  to identify trends and risk factors extends opportunities to develop locally tailored targeted  interventions  to  address  causes  of maternal  mortality  across  the  three  tiers  of government.

The  study  findings  can  be  used  at  all  levels of government and in communities to design targeted interventions to increase the coverage of quality maternal health services and prevent maternal deaths from preventable causes,  paving  the  way  for  the  country  to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The study further highlights the importance of strengthening measures that can improve the quality  of  maternal  health  services  in  health facilities.  Similarly,  a  need  is  felt  to  strengthen health  systems'  capacity  to  include  focused interventions for improving referral mechanisms and emergency transportation, as well as early screening for danger signs and addressing the causes of deaths at all levels of care.

This  study  sets  a  precedent  for  conducting nationwide  censuses  of  maternal  deaths  in future  censuses  to  estimate  the  MMR  and identify the causes of death periodically. This will provide a strong evidence base to inform investment and interventions to improve maternal health in Nepal.

Overall,  the  study  findings  clearly  showed the need for continued efforts to address the issue of maternal mortality and improve the quality of care for pregnant and postpartum women in Nepal.

## Maternal death notification form

We are saddened to hear about the demise of your family member. Past studies have shown that maternal mortality rate is high in Nepal. Information obtained from the analysis of data based on the number, location, and causes of deaths among women aged 15 to 49 years in the last 365 days will help the Government of Nepal to develop effective programs to prevent maternal deaths by improving safe maternity services.

The Ministry of Health and Population and the Central Bureau of Statistics have planned to conduct further studies in this census using the detailed information received from your family. All information will be kept confidential in accordance with the Statistics Act, 2015 and will only be used for studies on safe maternity service reform. On behalf of the Ministry of Health and Population and the Central Bureau of Statistics, we kindly request you to provide information in this regard and support the study on Safe Maternity Services.
