## FOREWORD

In modern times, improvements in knowledge and technological advances have greatly improved the health of mother and children. However, the past decade was marked by limited progress in reducing maternal mortality and a slow-down in the steady decline of childhood mortality observed since the mid 1950s in many countries, the latter being largely due to a failure to reduce neonatal mortality.

Every year, over four million babies less than one month of age die, most of them during the critical first week of life; and for every newborn who dies, another is stillborn. Most of these deaths are a consequence of the poor health and nutritional status of the mother coupled with inadequate care before, during, and after delivery. Unfortunately, the problem remains unrecognized or- worse- accepted as inevitable in many societies, in large part because it is so common.

Recognizing the large burden of maternal and neonatal ill-health on the development capacity of individuals, communities and societies, world leaders reaffirmed their commitment to invest in mothers and children by adopting specific goals and targets to reduce maternal and childhood-infant mortality as part of the Millennium Declaration.

There is a widely shared but mistaken idea that improvements in newborn health require sophisticated and expensive technologies and highly specialized staff.The reality is that many conditions that result in perinatal death can be prevented or treated without sophisticated and expensive technology.What is required is essential care during pregnancy, the assistance of a person with midwifery skills during childbirth and the immediate postpartum period, and a few critical interventions for the newborn during the first days of life.

It is against this background that we are proud to present the document Pregnancy, Childbirth, Postpartum and Newborn Care: A guide for essential practice , as new additions to the Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth tool kit. The guide provides a full range of updated, evidencebased norms and standards that will enable health care providers to give high quality care during pregnancy, delivery and in the postpartum period, considering the needs of the mother and her newborn baby.

We hope that the guide will be helpful for decision-makers, programme managers and health care providers in charting out their roadmap towards meeting the health needs of all mothers and children. We have the knowledge, our major challenge now is to translate this into action and to reach those women and children who are most in need.

O GLOSSARY AND ACRONYMS

## INTRODUCTION

The aim of Pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and newborn care guide for essential practice  (PCPNC) is to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide health care professionals in the management of women during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum, and post abortion, and newborns during their first week of life.

All recommendations are for skilled attendants working at the primary level of health care, either at the facility or in the community. They apply to all women attending antenatal care, in delivery, postpartum or post abortion care, or who come for emergency care, and to all newborns at birth and during the first week of life (or later) for routine and emergency care.

The PCPNC is a guide for clinical decision-making. It facilitates the collection, analysis, classification and use of relevant information by suggesting key questions, essential observations and/or examinations, and recommending appropriate research-based interventions. It promotes the early detection of complications and the initiation of early and appropriate treatment, including timely referral, if necessary.

Correct use of this guide should help reduce the high maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity rates prevalent in many parts of the developing world, thereby making pregnancy and childbirth safer.

The guide is not designed for immediate use. It is a generic guide and should first be adapted to local needs and resources. It should cover the most serious endemic conditions that the skilled birth attendant must be able to treat, and be made consistent with national treatment guidelines and other policies. It is accompanied by an adaptation guide to help countries prepare their own national guides and training and other supporting materials.

The first section, How to use the guide, describes how the guide is organized, the overall content and presentation. Each chapter begins with a short description of how to read and use it, to help the reader use the guide correctly.

The Guide has been developed by the Department of Reproductive Health and Research with contributions from the following WHO programmes:

- ■ Child and Adolesscent Health and Development
- ■ HIV/AIDS
- ■ Nutrition for Health and Development
- ■ Essential drugs and Medicines Policy
- ■ Vaccines and Biologicals
- ■ Communicable Diseases Control, Prevention and Eradication (tuberculosis, malaria, helminthiasis)
- ■ Gender and Women's Health
- ■ Mental Health and Substance Dependence
- ■ Blindness and Deafness

## HOW TO READ THE GUIDE

## Content

The Guide includes routine and emergency care for women and newborns during pregnancy, labour and delivery, postpartum and post abortion, as well as key preventive measures required to reduce the incidence of endemic and other diseases which add to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Most women and newborns using the services described in the Guide are not ill and/or do not have complications.They are able to wait in line when they come for a scheduled visit. However, the small proportion of women/newborns who are ill, have complications or are in labour, need urgent attention and care.

## The clinical content is divided into six sections which are as follows:

- ■ Quick check (triage), emergency management (called Rapid Assessment and Management or RAM) and referral, followed by a chapter on emergency treatments for the woman.
- ■ Post-abortion care.
- ■ Antenatal care.
- ■ Labour and delivery.
- ■ Postpartum care.
- ■ Newborn care.

In each of the six clinical sections listed above there is a series of flow, treatment and information charts which include:

- ■ Guidance on routine care, including monitoring the well-being of the mother and/or baby.
- ■ Early detection and management of complications.
- ■ Preventive measures.
- ■ Advice and counselling.

In addition to the clinical care outlined above, other sections in the guide include:

- ■ Advice on HIV.
- ■ Support for women with special needs.
- ■ Links with the community.
- ■ Drugs, supplies, equipment, universal precautions and laboratory tests.
- ■ Examples of clinical records.
- ■ Counselling and key messages for women and families.

There is an important section at the beginning of the Guide entitled Principles of good care . This includes principles of good care for all women, including those with special needs. It explains the organization of each visit to a healthcare facility, which applies to overall care. The principles are not repeated for each visit. A1-A5

Recommendations for the management of complications at secondary (referral) health care level can be found in the following guides for midwives and doctors:

- ■ Managing complications of pregnancy and childbirth (WHO/RHR/00.7)
- ■ Managing newborn problems.

These and other documents referred to in this Guide can be obtained from the Department of Reproductive Health and Research, Family and Community Health,World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.

rhrpublications@who.int.

This Guide is a tool for clinical decision-making. The content is presented in a frame work of coloured flow charts supported by information and treatment charts which give further details of care.

The framework is based on a syndromic approach whereby the skilled attendant identifies a limited number of key clinical signs and symptoms, enabling her/him to classify the condition according to severity and give appropriate treatment. Severity is marked in colour: red for emergencies, yellow for less urgent conditions which nevertheless need attention, and green for normal care.

SIGNS

<!-- image -->

## Flow charts

The flow charts include the following information:

1. Key questions to be asked.
2. Important observations and examinations to be made.
3. Possible findings (signs) based on information elicited from the questions, observations and, where appropriate, examinations.
4. Classification of the findings.
5. Treatment and advice related to the signs and classification.

'T reat,advise'means giving the treatment indicated (performing a procedure,prescribing drugs or other treatments,advising on possible side-effects and how to overcome them) and giving advice on other important practices.The treat and advise column is often crossreferenced to other treatment and/or information charts. T urn to these charts for more information.

TREAT AND ADVISE

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Use of colour

Colour is used in the flow charts to indicate the severity of a condition.

6. Green usually indicates no abnormal condition and therefore normal care is given, as outlined in the guide, with appropriate advice for home care and follow up.
7. Yellow indicates that there is a problem that can be treated without referral.
8. Red highlights an emergency which requires immediate treatment and, in most cases, urgent referral to a higher level health facility.

## Key sequential steps

The charts for normal and abnormal deliveries are presented in a framework of key sequential steps for a clean safe delivery .The key sequential steps for delivery are in a column on the left side of the page, while the column on the right has interventions which may be required if problems arise during delivery . Interventions may be linked to relevant treatment and/or information pages, and are cross-referenced to other parts of the Guide.

## Treatment and information pages

The flow charts are linked (cross-referenced) to relevant treatment and/or information pages in other parts of the Guide. These pages include information which is too detailed to include in the flow charts:

- ■ Treatments.
- ■ Advice and counselling.
- ■ Preventive measures.
- ■ Relevant procedures.

## Information and counselling sheets

These contain appropriate advice and counselling messages to provide to the woman, her partner and family. In addition, a section is included at the back of the Guide to support the skilled attendant in this effort. Individual sheets are provided with simplified versions of the messages on care during pregnancy (preparing a birth and emergency plan, clean home delivery, care for the mother and baby after delivery, breastfeeding and care after an abortion) to be given to the mother, her partner and family at the appropriate stage of pregnancy and childbirth.

These sheets are presented in a generic format. They will require adaptation to local conditions and language, and the addition of illustrations to enhance understanding, acceptability and attractiveness. Different programmes may prefer a different format such as a booklet or flip chart.

## ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING  THE GUIDE

Recommendations in the Guide are generic, made on many assumptions about the health characteristics of the population and the health care system (the setting, capacity and organization of services, resources and staffing).

## Population and endemic conditions

- ■ High maternal and perinatal mortality
- ■ Many adolescent pregnancies
- ■ High prevalence of endemic conditions: → Anaemia
- → Stable transmission of falciparum malaria
- → Hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale)
- → Sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS
- → Vitamin A and iron/folate deficiencies.

## Health care system

The Guide assumes that:

- ■ Routine and emergency pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care are provided at the primary level of the health care, e.g. at the facility near where the woman lives. This facility could be a health post, health centre or maternity clinic. It could also be a hospital with a delivery ward and outpatient clinic providing routine care to women from the neighbourhood.
- ■ A single skilled attendant is providing care. She may work at the health care centre, a maternity unit of a hospital or she may go to the woman's home, if necessary. However

there may be other health workers who receive the woman or support the skilled attendant when emergency complications occur.

- ■ Human resources, infrastructure, equipment, supplies and drugs are limited. However, essential drugs, IV fluids, supplies, gloves and essential equipment are available.
- ■ If a health worker with higher levels of skill (at the facility or a referral hospital) is providing pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care to women other than those referred, she follows the recommendations described in this Guide.
- ■ Routine visits and follow-up visits are 'scheduled' during office hours.
- ■ Emergency services ('unscheduled' visits) for labour and delivery, complications, or severe illness or deterioration are provided 24/24 hours, 7 days a week.
- ■ Women and babies with complications or expected complications are referred for further care to the secondary level of care, a referral hospital.
- ■ Referral and transportation are appropriate for the distance and other circumstances.They must be safe for the mother and the baby.
- ■ Some deliveries are conducted at home, attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) or relatives, or the woman delivers alone (but home delivery without a skilled attendant is not recommended).
- ■ Links with the community and traditional providers are established. Primary health care services and the community are involved in

maternal and newborn health issues.

- ■ Other programme activities, such as management of malaria, tuberculosis and other lung diseases, voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) for HIV, and infant feeding counselling, that require specific training, are delivered by a different provider, at the same facility or at the referral hospital. Detection, initial treatment and referral are done by the skilled attendant.

## Knowledge and skills of care providers

This Guide assumes that professionals using it have the knowledge and skills in providing the care it describes. Other training materials must be used to bring the skills up to the level assumed by the Guide.

## Adaptation of the Guide

It is essential that this generic Guide is adapted to national and local situations, not only within the context of existing health priorities and resources, but also within the context of respect and sensitivity to the needs of women, newborns and the communities to which they belong.

An adaptation guide is available to assist national experts in modifying the Guide according to national needs, for different demographic and epidemiological conditions, resources and settings.The adaptation guide offers some alternatives. It includes guidance on developing information and counselling tools so that each programme manager can develop a format which is most comfortable for her/him.

## PRINCIPLES OF GOOD CARE

<!-- image -->

- UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS AND CLEANLINESS A4
- ORGANIZING A VISIT A5

<!-- image -->

These principles of good care apply to all contacts between the skilled attendant and all women and their babies; they are not repeated in each section. Care-givers should therefore familiarize themselves with the following principles before using the Guide. The principles concern:

- ■
- Communication . A2
- ■ Workplace and administrative procedures
- ■ Universal precautions and cleanliness
- ■ Organizing a visit . A5

<!-- image -->

## COMMUNICATION

## Communicating with the woman (and her companion)

- ■ Make the woman (and her companion) feel welcome.
- ■ Be friendly, respectful and non-judgmental at all times.
- ■ Use simple and clear language.
- ■ Encourage her to ask questions.
- ■ Ask and provide information related to her needs.
- ■ Support her in understanding her options and making decisions.
- ■ At any examination or before any procedure: → seek her permission and
- → inform her of what you are doing.
- ■ Summarize the most important information, including the information on routine laboratory tests and treatments.

Verify that she understands emergency signs, treatment instructions, and when and where to return. Check for understanding by asking her to explain or demonstrate treatment instructions.

## Privacy and confidentiality

In all contacts with the woman and her partner:

- ■ Ensure a private place for the examination and counselling.
- ■ Ensure, when discussing sensitive subjects, that you cannot be overheard.
- ■ Make sure you have the woman's consent before discussing with her partner or family.
- ■ Never discuss confidential information about clients with other providers, or outside the health facility.
- ■ Organize the examination area so that, during examination, the woman is protected from the view of other people (curtain, screen, wall).
- ■ Ensure all records are confidential and kept locked away.
- ■ Limit access to logbooks and registers to responsible providers only.

## Prescribing and recommending treatments and preventive measures for the woman and/or her baby

When giving a treatment (drug, vaccine, bednet, condom) at the clinic, or prescribing measures to be followed at home:

- ■ Explain to the woman what the treatment is and why it should be given.
- ■ Explain to her that the treatment will not harm her or her baby, and that not taking it may be more dangerous.
- ■ Give clear and helpful advice on how to take the drug regularly:
- → for example: take 2 tablets 3 times a day, thus every 8 hours, in the morning, afternoon and evening with some water and after a meal, for 5 days.
- ■ Demonstrate the procedure.
- ■ Explain how the treatment is given to the baby. Watch her as she does the first treatment in the clinic.
- ■ Explain the side-effects to her. Explain that they are not serious, and tell her how to manage them.
- ■ Advise her to return if she has any problems or concerns about taking the drugs.
- ■ Explore any barriers she or her family may have, or have heard from others, about using the treatment, where possible:
- → Has she or anyone she knows used the treatment or preventive measure before?
- → Were there problems?
- → Reinforce the correct information that she has, and try to clarify the incorrect information.
- ■ Discuss with her the importance of buying and taking the prescribed amount. Help her to think about how she will be able to purchase this.

## WORKPLACE AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

## Workplace

- ■ Service hours should be clearly posted.
- ■ Be on time with appointments or inform the woman/women if she/they need to wait.
- ■ Before beginning the services, check that equipment is clean and functioning and that supplies and drugs are in place.
- ■ Keep the facility clean by regular cleaning.
- ■ At the end of the service:
- → discard litter and sharps safely
- → prepare for disinfection; clean and disinfect equipment and supplies
- → replace linen, prepare for washing
- → replenish supplies and drugs
- → ensure routine cleaning of all areas.
- ■ Hand over essential information to the colleague who follows on duty.

## Daily and occasional administrative activities

- ■ Keep records of equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines.
- ■ Check availability and functioning of essential equipment (order stocks of supplies, drugs, vaccines and contraceptives before they run out).
- ■ Establish staffing lists and schedules.
- ■ Complete periodic reports on births, deaths and other indicators as required, according to instructions.

## Record keeping

- ■ Always record findings on a clinical record and home-based record. Record treatments, reasons for referral, and follow-up recommendations at the time the observation is made.
- ■ Do not record confidential information on the home-based record if the woman is unwilling.
- ■ Maintain and file appropriately:
- → all clinical records
- → all other documentation.

## International conventions

The health facility should not allow distribution of free or low-cost suplies or products within the scope of the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. It should also be tobacco free and support a tobacco-free environment.

## UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS AND CLEANLINESS

Observe these precautions to protect the woman and her baby, and you as the health provider, from infections with bacteria and viruses, including HIV.

## Wash hands

- ■ Wash hands with soap and water:
- → Before and after caring for a woman or newborn, and before any treatment procedure
- → Whenever the hands (or any other skin area) are contaminated with blood or other body fluids
- → After removing the gloves, because they may have holes
- → After changing soiled bedsheets or clothing.
- ■ Keep nails short.

## Wear gloves

- ■ Wear sterile or highly disinfected gloves when performing vaginal examination, delivery , cord cutting, repair of episiotomy or tear, blood drawing.
- ■ Wear long sterile or highly disinfected gloves for manual removal of placenta.
- ■ Wear clean gloves when:
- → Handling and cleaning instruments
- → Handling contaminated waste
- → Cleaning blood and body fluid spills.

## Protect yourself from blood and other body fluids during deliveries

- → Wear gloves; cover any cuts, abrasions or broken skin with a waterproof bandage; take care when handling any sharp instruments (use good light); and practice safe sharps disposal.
- → Wear a long apron made from plastic or other fluid resistant material, and shoes.
- → If possible, protect your eyes from splashes of blood. Normal spectacles are adequate eye protection.

## Practice safe sharps disposal

- ■ Keep a puncture resistant container nearby.
- ■ Use each needle and syringe only once.
- ■ Do not recap, bend or break needles after giving an injection.
- ■ Drop all used (disposable) needles, plastic syringes and blades directly into this container, without recapping, and without passing to another person.
- ■ Empty or send for incineration when the container is three-quarters full.

## Practice safe waste disposal

- ■ Dispose of placenta or blood, or body fluid contaminated items, in leak-proof containers.
- ■ Burn or bury contaminated solid waste.
- ■ Wash hands, gloves and containers after disposal of infectious waste.
- ■ Pour liquid waste down a drain or flushable toilet.
- ■ Wash hands after disposal of infectious waste.

## Deal with contaminated laundry

- ■ Collect clothing or sheets stained with blood or body fluids and keep them separately from other laundry, wearing gloves or use a plastic bag. DO NOT touch them directly.
- ■ Rinse off blood or other body fluids before washing with soap.

## Sterilize and clean contaminated equipment

- ■ Make sure that instruments which penetrate the skin (such as needles) are adequately sterilized, or that single-use instruments are disposed of after one use.
- ■ Thoroughly clean or disinfect any equipment which comes into contact with intact skin (according to instructions).
- ■ Use bleach for cleaning bowls and buckets, and for blood or body fluid spills.

## Clean and disinfect gloves

- ■ Wash the gloves in soap and water.
- ■ Check for damage: Blow gloves full of air, twist the cuff closed, then hold under clean water and look for air leaks. Discard if damaged.
- ■ Soak overnight in bleach solution with 0.5% available chlorine (made by adding 90 ml water to 10 ml bleach containing 5% available chlorine).
- ■ Dry away from direct sunlight.
- ■ Dust inside with talcum powder or starch.

This produces disinfected gloves.They are not sterile.

Good quality latex gloves can be disinfected 5 or more times.

## Sterilize gloves

- ■ Sterilize by autoclaving or highly disinfect by steaming or boiling.

## Receive and respond immediately

Receive every woman and newborn baby seeking care immediately after arrival (or organize reception by another provider).

- ■ Perform Quick Check on all new incoming women and babies and those in the waiting room, especially if no-one is receiving them . B2
- ■ At the first emergency sign on Quick Check, begin emergency assessment and management (RAM) for the woman, or examine the newborn . J1-J11 B1-B7
- ■ If she is in labour, accompany her to an appropriate place and follow the steps as in Childbirth: labour, delivery and immediate postpartum care . D1-D29
- ■ If she has priority signs, examine her immediately using Antenatal care , Postpartum or Post-abortion care charts . B18-B22 E1-E10 C1-C18
- ■ If no emergency or priority sign on RAM or not in labour, invite her to wait in the waiting room.
- ■ If baby is newly born, looks small, examine immediately. Do not let the mother wait in the queue.

<!-- image -->

## Begin each emergency care visit

- ■ Introduce yourself.
- ■ Ask the name of the woman.
- ■ Encourage the companion to stay with the woman.
- ■ Explain all procedures, ask permission, and keep the woman informed as much as you can
- about what you are doing. If she is unconscious, talk to the companion.
- ■ Ensure and respect privacy during examination and discussion.
- ■ If she came with a baby and the baby is well, ask the companion to take care of the baby during the maternal examination and treatment.

## Care of woman or baby referred for special care to secondary level facility

- ■ When a woman or baby is referred to a secondary level care facility because of a specific problem or complications, the underlying assumption of the Guide is that, at referral level, the woman/baby will be assessed, treated, counselled and advised on follow-up for that particular condition/ complication.
- ■ Follow-up for that specific condition will be either: → organized by the referral facility or
- → written instructions will be given to the woman/baby for the skilled attendant at the primary level who referred the woman/baby.
- → the woman/baby will be advised to go for a follow-up visit within 2 weeks according to severity of the condition.
- ■ Routine care continues at the primary care level where it was initiated.

## Begin each routine visit (for the woman and/or the baby)

- ■ Greet the woman and offer her a seat.
- ■ Introduce yourself.
- ■ Ask her name (and the name of the baby).
- ■ Ask her:
- → Why did you come? For yourself or for your baby?
- → For a scheduled (routine) visit?
- → For specific complaints about you or your baby?
- → First or follow-up visit?
- → Do you want to include your companion or other family member (parent if adolescent) in the examination and discussion?
- ■ If the woman is recently delivered, assess the baby or ask to see the baby if not with the mother.
- ■ If antenatal care, always revise the birth plan at the end of the visit after completing the chart.
- ■ For a postpartum visit, if she came with the baby, also examine the baby:
- → Follow the appropriate charts according to pregnancy status/age of the baby and purpose of visit.
- → Follow all steps on the chart and in relevant boxes.
- ■ Unless the condition of the woman or the baby requires urgent referral to hospital, give preventive measures if due even if the woman has a condition "in yellow" that requires special treatment.
- ■ If follow-up visit is within a week, and if no other complaints:
- → Assess the woman for the specific condition requiring follow-up only
- → Compare with earlier assessment and reclassify.
- ■ If a follow-up visit is more than a week after the initial examination (but not the next scheduled visit):
- → Repeat the whole assessment as required for an antenatal, post-abortion, postpartum or newborn visit according to the schedule
- → If antenatal visit, revise the birth plan.

## During the visit

- ■ Explain all procedures,
- ■ Ask permission before undertaking an examination or test.
- ■ Keep the woman informed throughout. Discuss findings with her (and her partner).
- ■ Ensure privacy during the examination and discussion.

## At the end of the visit

- ■ Ask the woman if she has any questions.
- ■ Summarize the most important messages with her.
- ■ Encourage her to return for a routine visit (tell her when) and if she has any concerns.
- ■ Fill the Home-Based Maternal Record (HBMR) and give her the appropriate information sheet.
- ■ Ask her if there are any points which need to be discussed and would she like support for this.

## QUICK CHECK, RAPID ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- ■ Perform Quick check immediately after the woman arrives . If any danger sign is seen, help the woman and send her quickly to the emergency room. B2
- ■ Always begin a clinical visit with Rapid assessment and management (RAM) : B3-B7
- → Check for emergency signs first . If present, provide emergency treatment and refer the woman urgently to hospital. Complete the referral form . N2 B3-B6
- → Check for priority signs. If present, manage according to charts . B7
- → If no emergency or priority signs, allow the woman to wait in line for routine care, according to pregnancy status.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## QUICK CHECK

A person responsible for initial reception of women of childbearing age and newborns seeking care should:

- ■ assess the general condition of the careseeker(s) immediately on arrival
- ■ periodically repeat this procedure if the line is long.

If a woman is very sick, talk to her companion.

## ASK, CHECK RECORD LOOK, LISTEN, FEEL

- ■ Why did you come?
- → for yourself?
- → for the baby?
- ■ How old is the baby?
- ■ What is the concern?

- ■ Give the treatment and refer the woman urgently to hospital . B17
- ■ If drug treatment, give the first dose of the drugs before referral. Do not delay referral by giving non-urgent treatments.

<!-- image -->

## AIRWAY, BREATHING AND CIRCULATION

## Manage the airway and breathing

If the woman has great difficulty breathing and:

- ■ If you suspect obstruction:
- → Try to clear the airway and dislodge obstruction
- → Help the woman to find the best position for breathing
- → Urgently refer the woman to hospital.
- ■ If the woman is unconscious:
- → Keep her on her back, arms at the side
- → Tilt her head backwards (unless trauma is suspected)
- → Lift her chin to open airway
- → Inspect her mouth for foreign body; remove if found
- → Clear secretions from throat.
- ■ If the woman is not breathing:
- → Ventilate with bag and mask until she starts breathing spontaneously
- ■ If woman still has great difficulty breathing, keep her propped up, and
- ■ Refer the woman urgently to hospital.

## Insert IV line and give fluids

- ■ Wash hands with soap and water and put on gloves.
- ■ Clean woman's skin with spirit at site for IV line.
- ■ Insert an intravenous line (IV line) using a 16-18 gauge needle.
- ■ Attach Ringer's lactate or normal saline. Ensure infusion is running well.

Give fluids at rapid rate if shock, systolic BP&lt;90 mmHg, pulse&gt;110/minute, or heavy vaginal bleeding:

- ■ Infuse 1 litre in 15-20 minutes (as rapid as possible).
- ■ Infuse 1 litre in 30 minutes at 30 ml/minute. Repeat if necessary.
- ■ Monitor every 15 minutes for:
- → blood pressure (BP) and pulse
- → shortness of breath or puffiness.
- ■ Reduce the infusion rate to 3 ml/minute (1 litre in 6-8 hours) when pulse slows to less than 100/minute, systolic BP increases to 100 mmHg or higher.
- ■ Reduce the infusion rate to 0.5 ml/minute if breathing difficulty or puffiness develops.
- ■ Monitor urine output.
- ■ Record time and amount of fluids given.

Give fluids at moderate rate if severe abdominal pain, obstructed labour, ectopic pregnancy, dangerous fever or dehydration:

- ■ Infuse 1 litre in 2-3 hours.

Give fluids at slow rate if severe anaemia/severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia:

- ■ Infuse 1 litre in 6-8 hours.

## If intravenous access not possible

- ■ Give oral rehydration solution (ORS) by mouth if able to drink, or by nasogastric (NG) tube.
- ■ Quantity of ORS: 300 to 500 ml in 1 hour.

DO NOT give ORS to a woman who is unconscious or has convulsions.

## BLEEDING

## Massage uterus and expel clots

If heavy postpartum bleeding persists after placenta is delivered, or uterus is not well contracted (is soft):

- ■ Place cupped palm on uterine fundus and feel for state of contraction.
- ■ Massage fundus in a circular motion with cupped palm until uterus is well contracted.
- ■ When well contracted, place fingers behind fundus and push down in one swift action to expel clots.
- ■ Collect blood in a container placed close to the vulva. Measure or estimate blood loss, and record.

## Apply bimanual uterine compression

If heavy postpartum bleeding persists despite uterine massage, oxytocin/ergometrine treatment and removal of placenta:

- ■ Wear sterile or clean gloves.
- ■ Introduce the right hand into the vagina, clenched fist, with the back of the hand directed posteriorly and the knuckles in the anterior fornix.
- ■ Place the other hand on the abdomen behind the uterus and squeeze the uterus firmly between the two hands.
- ■ Continue compression until bleeding stops (no bleeding if the compression is released).
- ■ If bleeding persists, apply aortic compression and transport woman to hospital.

## Apply aortic compression

If heavy postpartum bleeding persists despite uterine massage, oxytocin/ergometrine treatment and removal of placenta:

- ■ Feel for femoral pulse.
- ■ Apply pressure above the umbilicus to stop bleeding.Apply sufficient pressure until femoral pulse is not felt.
- ■ After finding correct site, show assistant or relative how to apply pressure, if necessary.
- ■ Continue pressure until bleeding stops. If bleeding persists, keep applying pressure while transporting woman to hospital.

## Give oxytocin

If heavy postpartum bleeding

| Initial dose     | Continuing dose                                                 | Maximum dose                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| IM/IV: 10 IU     | IM/IV: repeat 10 IU after 20 minutes if heavy bleeding persists | Not more than 3 litres of IV fluids containing |
| IV infusion:     | IV infusion:                                                    | oxytocin                                       |
| 20 IU in 1 litre | 10 IU in 1 litre                                                |                                                |
| at 60 drops/min  | at 30 drops/min                                                 |                                                |

## Give ergometrine

If heavy bleeding in early pregnancy or postpartum bleeding (after oxytocin) but DO NOT give if eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, or hypertension

| Initial dose        | Continuing dose                                                  | Maximum dose                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| IM/IV:0.2 mg slowly | IM: repeat 0.2 mg IM after 15 minutes if heavy bleeding persists | Not more than 5 doses (total 1.0 mg) |

## Remove placenta and fragments manually

- ■ If placenta not delivered 1 hour after delivery of the baby, OR
- ■ If heavy vaginal bleeding continues despite massage and oxytocin and placenta cannot be delivered by controlled cord traction, or if placenta is incomplete and bleeding continues.

## Preparation

- ■ Explain to the woman the need for manual removal of the placenta and obtain her consent.
- ■ Insert an IV line. If bleeding, give fluids rapidly. If not bleeding, give fluids slowly . B9
- ■ Assist woman to get onto her back.
- ■ Give diazepam (10mg IM/IV).
- ■ Clean vulva and perineal area.
- ■ Ensure the bladder is empty. Catheterize if necessary B12

.

- ■ Wash hands and forearms well and put on long sterile gloves (and an apron or gown if available).

## Technique

- ■ With the left hand, hold the umbilical cord with the clamp.Then pull the cord gently until it is horizontal.
- ■ Insert right hand into the vagina and up into the uterus.
- ■ Leave the cord and hold the fundus with the left hand in order to support the fundus of the uterus and to provide counter-traction during removal.
- ■ Move the fingers of the right hand sideways until edge of the placenta is located.
- ■ Detach the placenta from the implantation site by keeping the fingers tightly together and using the edge of the hand to gradually make a space between the placenta and the uterine wall.
- ■ Proceed gradually all around the placental bed until the whole placenta is detached from the uterine wall.
- ■ Withdraw the right hand from the uterus gradually, bringing the placenta with it.
- ■ Explore the inside of the uterine cavity to ensure all placental tissue has been removed.
- ■ With the left hand, provide counter-traction to the fundus through the abdomen by pushing it in the opposite direction of the hand that is being withdrawn.This prevents inversion of the uterus.
- ■ Examine the uterine surface of the placenta to ensure that lobes and membranes are complete. If any placental lobe or tissue fragments are missing, explore again the uterine cavity to remove them.

If hours or days have passed since delivery, or if the placenta is retained due to constriction ring or closed cervix, it may not be possible to put the hand into the uterus. DO NOT persist. Refer urgently to hospital . B17

<!-- image -->

If the placenta does not separate from the uterine surface by gentle sideways movement of the fingertips at the line of cleavage, suspect placenta accreta. DO NOT persist in efforts to remove placenta. Refer urgently to hospital . B17

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## After manual removal of the placenta

- ■ Repeat oxytocin 10IU IM/IV.
- ■ Massage the fundus of the uterus to encourage a tonic uterine contraction.
- ■ Give ampicillin 2 g IV/IM . B15
- ■ If fever &gt;38.5°C, foul-smelling lochia or history of rupture of membranes for 18 or more hours, also give gentamicin 80 mg IM . B15
- ■ If bleeding stops:
- → give fluids slowly for at least 1 hour after removal of placenta.
- ■ If heavy bleeding continues:
- → give ergometrine 0.2 mg IM
- → give 20 IU oxytocin in each litre of IV fluids and infuse rapidly
- → Refer urgently to hospital . B17
- ■ During transportation, feel continuously whether uterus is well contracted (hard and round). If not, massage and repeat oxytocin 10 IU IM/IV.
- ■ Provide bimanual or aortic compression if severe bleeding before and during transportation . B10

<!-- image -->

## REPAIR THE TEAR AND EMPTY BLADDER

## Repair the tear or episiotomy

- ■ Examine the tear and determine the degree:
- → The tear is small and involved only vaginal mucosa and connective tissues and underlying muscles (first or second degree tear). If the tear is not bleeding, leave the wound open.
- → The tear is long and deep through the perineum and involves the anal sphincter and rectal mucosa (third and fourth degree tear). Cover it with a clean pad and refer the woman urgently to hospital . B17
- ■ If first or second degree tear and heavy bleeding persists after applying pressure over the wound:
- → Suture the tear or refer for suturing if no one is available with suturing skills.
- → Suture the tear using universal precautions, aseptic technique and sterile equipment.
- → Use a needle holder and a 21 gauge, 4 cm, curved needle.
- → Use absorbable polyglycon suture material.
- → Make sure that the apex of the tear is reached before you begin suturing.
- → Ensure that edges of the tear match up well.

DO NOT suture if more than 12 hours since delivery. Refer woman to hospital.

## Empty bladder

If bladder is distended and the woman is unable to pass urine:

- ■ Encourage the woman to urinate.
- ■ If she is unable to urinate, catheterize the bladder:
- → Wash hands
- → Clean urethral area with antiseptic
- → Put on clean gloves
- → Spread labia. Clean area again
- → Insert catheter up to 4 cm
- → Measure urine and record amount
- → Remove catheter.

## ECLAMPSIA AND PRE-ECLAMPSIA (1)

## Give magnesium sulphate

If severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia

## IV/IM combined dose (loading dose)

- ■ Insert IV line and give fluids slowly (normal saline or Ringer's lactate) 1 litre in 6-8 hours (3ml/minute) . B9
- ■ Give 4g of magnesium sulphate (20 ml of 20% solution) IV slowly over 20 minutes (woman may feel warm during injection).

## AND:

- ■ Give 10 g of magnesium sulphate IM: give 5 g (10 ml of 50% solution) IM deep in upper outer quadrant of each buttock with 1 ml of 2% lignocaine in the same syringe.

## If unable to give IV, give IM only (loading dose)

- ■ Give 10 g of magnesium sulphate IM: give 5 g (10 ml of 50% solution) IM deep in upper outer quadrant of each buttock with 1 ml of 2% lignocaine in the same syringe.

## If convulsions recur

- ■ After 15 minutes, give an additional 2 g of magnesium sulphate (10 ml of 20% solution) IV over 20 minutes. If convulsions still continue, give diazepam . B14

## If referral delayed for long, or the woman is in late labour, continue treatment:

- ■ Give 5 g of 50% magnesium sulphate solution IM with 1 ml of 2% lignocaine every 4 hours in alternate buttocks until 24 hours after birth or after last convulsion (whichever is later).
- ■ Monitor urine output: collect urine and measure the quantity.
- ■ Before giving the next dose of magnesium sulphate, ensure:
- → knee jerk is present
- → urine output &gt;100 ml/4 hrs
- → respiratory rate &gt;16/min.
- ■ DO NOT give the next dose if any of these signs:
- → knee jerk absent
- → urine output &lt;100 ml/4 hrs
- → respiratory rate &lt;16/min.
- ■ Record findings and drugs given.

## Important considerations in caring for a woman with eclampsia or pre-eclampsia

- ■ Do not leave the woman on her own.
- → Help her into the left side position and protect her from fall and injury
- → Place padded tongue blades between her teeth to prevent a tongue bite, and secure it to prevent aspiration ( DO NOT attempt this during a convulsion).
- ■ Give IV 20% magnesium sulphate slowly over 20 minutes. Rapid injection can cause respiratory failure or death.
- → If respiratory depression (breathing less than 16/minute) occurs after magnesium sulphate, do not give any more magnesium sulphate. Give the antidote: calcium gluconate 1 g IV (10 ml of 10% solution) over 10 minutes.
- ■ DO NOT give intravenous fluids rapidly.
- ■ DO NOT give intravenously 50% magnesium sulphate without dilluting it to 20%.
- ■ Refer urgently to hospital unless delivery is imminent.

→

If delivery imminent, manage as in Childbirth

- → Keep her in the left side position
- → If a convulsion occurs during the journey , give magnesium sulphate and protect her from fall and injury .

- → bulging perineum
- → any visible fetal parts
- → vaginal bleeding
- → leaking amniotic fluid; if yes, is it meconium stained, foul-smelling?
- → warts, keloid tissue or scars that may interfere with delivery.

## Perform vaginal examination

- ■ DO NOT shave the perineal area.
- ■ Prepare:
- → clean gloves
- → swabs, pads.
- ■ Wash hands with soap before and after each examination.
- ■ Wash vulva and perineal areas.
- ■ Put on gloves.
- ■ Position the woman with legs flexed and apart.

DO NOT perform vaginal examination if bleeding now or at any time after 7 months of pregnancy.

- ■ Perform gentle vaginal examination (do not start during a contraction):
- → Determine cervical dilatation in centimetres.
- → Feel for presenting part. Is it hard, round and smooth (the head)? If not, identify the presenting part.
- → Feel for membranes - are they intact?
- → Feel for cord - is it felt? Is it pulsating? If so, act immediately as on . D15

## DELIVER THE BABY

- ■ Ensure controlled delivery of the head:
- → Keep one hand gently on the head as it advances with contractions.
- → Support perineum with other hand and cover anus with pad held in position by side of hand during delivery .
- → Leave the perineum visible (between thumb and first finger).
- → Ask the mother to breathe steadily and not to push during delivery of the head.
- → Encourage rapid breathing with mouth open.

| ■ Await spontaneous rotation of shoulders and delivery (within 1-2 minutes). ■ Apply gentle downward pressure to deliver top shoulder. ■ Then lift baby up, towards the mother's abdomen to deliver lower shoulder. ■ Place baby on abdomen or in mother's arms. ■ Note time of delivery. | ■ If delay in delivery of shoulders: → DO NOT panic but call for help and ask companion to assist → Manage as in Stuck shoulders . ■ If placing newborn on abdomen is not acceptable, or the mother cannot hold the baby, place the baby in a clean, warm, safe place close to the mother. D17        |
| ■ Thoroughly dry the baby immediately.Wipe eyes. Discard wet cloth. ■ Assess baby's breathing while drying. ■ If the baby is not crying, observe breathing: → breathing well (chest rising)? → not breathing or gasping?                                                                  | DO NOT leave the baby wet - she/he will become cold. ■ If the baby is not breathing or gasping (unless baby is dead, macerated, severely malformed): → Cut cord quickly: transfer to a firm, warm surface; start Newborn resuscitation . ■ CALL FOR HELP - one person should care for the mother.

## THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR: DELIVER THE PLACENTA

Use this chart for care of the woman between birth of the baby and delivery of placenta.

## MONITOR MOTHER EVERY 5 MINUTES:

- ■ For emergency signs, using rapid assessment (RAM)
- ■ Feel if uterus is well contracted.
- ■ Mood and behaviour (distressed, anxious)

<!-- image -->

.

<!-- image -->

- ■ Time since third stage began (time since birth).
- ■ Record findings, treatments and procedures in Labour record and Partograph (pp.N4-N6).
- ■ Give Supportive care . D6-D7
- ■ Never leave the woman alone.

<!-- image -->

## DELIVER THE PLACENTA

- ■ Ensure 10IU oxytocin IM is given

.

<!-- image -->

- ■ Await strong uterine contraction (2-3 minutes) and deliver placenta by controlled cord traction :
- → Place side of one hand (usually left) above symphysis pubis with palm facing towards the mother's umbilicus.This applies counter traction to the uterus during controlled cord traction. At the same time, apply steady, sustained controlled cord traction.
- → If placenta does not descend during 30-40 seconds of controlled cord traction, release both cord traction and counter traction on the abdomen and wait until the uterus is well contracted again. Then repeat controlled cord traction with counter traction.
- → As the placenta is coming out, catch in both hands to prevent tearing of the membranes.
- → If the membranes do not slip out spontaneously, gently twist them into a rope and move them up and down to assist separation without tearing them.
- ■ Check that placenta and membranes are complete.

.

## MONITOR BABY EVERY 15 MINUTES:

- ■ Breathing: listen for grunting, look for chest in-drawing and fast breathing
- ■ Warmth: check to see if feet are cold to touch

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## TREAT AND ADVISE IF REQUIRED

- ■ If, after 30 minutes of giving oxytocin, the placenta is not delivered and the woman is NOT bleeding:
- → Empty bladder B12
- → Encourage breastfeeding
- → Repeat controlled cord traction.
- ■ If woman is bleeding, manage as on B5
- ■ If placenta is not delivered in another 30 minutes (1 hour after delivery):
- → Remove placenta manually B11
- → Give appropriate IM/IV antibiotic . B15
- ■ If in 1 hour unable to remove placenta:
- → Refer the woman to hospital B17
- → Insert an IV line and give fluids with 20 IU of oxytocin at 30 drops per minute during transfer . B9
- DO NOT exert excessive traction on the cord.
- DO NOT squeeze or push the uterus to deliver the placenta.
- ■ If placenta is incomplete:
- → Remove placental fragments manually
- → Give appropriate IM/IV antibiotic B15

## DELIVER THE PLACENTA

## TREAT AND ADVISE, IF REQUIRED

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- ■ Check that uterus is well contracted and there is no heavy bleeding.

- ■ Repeat check every 5 minutes.

- ■ Examine perineum, lower vagina and vulva for tears.

- ■ Collect, estimate and record blood loss throughout third stage and immediately afterwards.

- ■ Clean the woman and the area beneath her. Put sanitary pad or folded clean cloth under her buttocks to collect blood. Help her to change clothes if necessary.

- ■ Keep the mother and baby in delivery room for a minimum of one hour after delivery of placenta.

- ■ Dispose of placenta in the correct, safe and culturally appropriate manner.

- ■ If heavy bleeding:

- → Massage uterus to expel clots if any, until it is hard . B10

- → Give oxytocin 10 IU IM . B10

- → Call for help.

- → Start an IV line , add 20 IU of oxytocin to IV fluids and give at 60 drops per minute B9

.

- → Empty the bladder . B12

- ■ If bleeding persists and uterus is soft:

- → Continue massaging uterus until it is hard.

- → Apply bimanual or aortic compression . B10

- → Continue IV fluids with 20 IU of oxytocin at 30 drops per minute.

- → Refer woman urgently to hospital . B17

- ■ If third degree tear (involving rectum or anus), refer urgently to hospital B17

.

- ■ For other tears: apply pressure over the tear with a sterile pad or gauze and put legs together. DO NOT cross ankles.

- ■ Check after 5 minutes. If bleeding persists, repair the tear . B12

- ■ If blood loss ≈ 250ml, but bleeding has stopped:

- → Plan to keep the woman in the facility for 24 hours.

- → Monitor intensively (every 30 minutes) for 4 hours:

- → BP , pulse

- → vaginal bleeding

- → uterus, to make sure it is well contracted.

- → Assist the woman when she first walks after resting and recovering.

- → If not possible to observe at the facility, refer to hospital B17

.

- ■ If disposing placenta:

- → Use gloves when handling placenta.

- → Put placenta into a bag and place it into a leak-proof container.

- → Always carry placenta in a leak-proof container.

- → Incinerate the placenta or bury it at least 10 m away from a water source, in a 2 m deep pit.

If not felt: ■ Hold the baby gently with hands around each thigh and thumbs on sacrum. ■ Gently guiding the baby down, turn the baby, keeping the back uppermost until the shoulder which was posterior (below) is now anterior (at the top) and the arm is released. ■ Then turn the baby back, again keeping the back uppermost to deliver the other arm. ■ Then proceed with delivery of head as described above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ■ If trapped head (and baby is dead)                      | ■ Tie a 1 kg weight to the baby's feet and await full dilatation. ■ Then proceed with delivery of head as described above. NEVER pull on the breech DO NOT allow the woman to push until the cervix is fully dilated. Pushing too soon may cause the head to be trapped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| ■ Fetal head is delivered, but shoulders are stuck and cannot be delivered.                | ■ Call for additional help. ■ Prepare for newborn resuscitation. ■ Explain the problem to the woman and her companion. ■ Ask the woman to lie on her back while gripping her legs tightly flexed against her chest, with knees wide apart.Ask the companion or other helper to keep the legs in that position. ■ Perform an adequate episiotomy. ■ Ask an assistant to apply continuous pressure downwards, with the palm of the hand on the abdomen directly above the pubic area, while you maintain continuous downward traction on the fetal head.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ■ If the shoulders are still not delivered and surgical help is not available immediately. | ■ Remain calm and explain to the woman that you need her cooperation to try another position. ■ Assist her to adopt a kneeling on 'all fours' position and ask her companion to hold her steady - this simple change of position is sometimes sufficient to dislodge the impacted shoulder and achieve delivery. ■ Introduce the right hand into the vagina along the posterior curve of the sacrum. ■ Attempt to deliver the posterior shoulder or arm using pressure from the finger of the right hand to hook the posterior shoulder and arm downwards and forwards through the vagina. ■ Complete the rest of delivery as normal. ■ If not successful, refer urgently to hospital . DO NOT pull excessively on the head. B17 |

| ■ Second stage of labour    | ■ Deliver the first baby following the usual procedure. Resuscitate if necessary. Label her/him Twin 1. ■ Ask helper to attend to the first baby. ■ Palpate uterus immediately to determine the lie of the second baby. If transverse or oblique lie, gently turn the baby by abdominal manipulation to head or breech presentation. ■ Check the presentation by vaginal examination. Check the fetal heart rate. ■ Await the return of strong contractions and spontaneous rupture of the second bag of membranes, usually within 1 hour of birth of first baby, but may be longer. ■ Stay with the woman and continue monitoring her and the fetal heart rate intensively. ■ Remove wet cloths from underneath her. If feeling chilled, cover her. ■ When the membranes rupture, perform vaginal examination to check for prolapsed cord. If present, see Prolapsed cord . ■ When strong contractions restart, ask the mother to bear down when she feels ready. ■ Deliver the second baby. Resuscitate if necessary. Label her/him Twin 2. ■ After cutting the cord, ask the helper to attend to the second baby. ■ Palpate the uterus for a third baby. If a third baby is felt, proceed as described above. If no third baby is felt, go to third stage of labour. DO NOT attempt to deliver the placenta until all the babies are born. DO NOT give the mother oxytocin until after the birth of all babies. D15 D3 |
| ■ Third stage of labour     | ■ Give oxytocin 10 IU IM after making sure there is not another baby. ■ When the uterus is well contracted, deliver the placenta and membranes by controlled cord traction, applying traction to all cords together . ■ Before and after delivery of the placenta and membranes, observe closely for vaginal bleeding because this woman is at greater risk of postpartum haemorrhage. If bleeding, see . ■ Examine the placenta and membranes for completeness.There may be one large placenta with 2 umbilical cords, or a separate placenta with an umbilical cord for each baby.

## CARE OF THE MOTHER AND NEWBORN WITHIN FIRST HOUR OF DELIVERY OF PLACENTA

Use this chart for woman and newborn during the first hour after complete delivery of placenta.

## MONITOR MOTHER EVERY 15 MINUTES:

- ■ For emergency signs, using rapid assessment (RAM)

.

<!-- image -->

- ■ Feel if uterus is hard and round.
- ■ Record findings, treatments and procedures in Labour record and Partograph
- ■ Keep mother and baby in delivery room do not separate them .
- ■ Never leave the woman and newborn alone.

## CARE OF MOTHER AND NEWBORN

## WOMAN

- ■ Assess the amount of vaginal bleeding.
- ■ Encourage the woman to eat and drink.
- ■ Ask the companion to stay with the mother.
- ■ Encourage the woman to pass urine.

## NEWBORN

- ■ Wipe the eyes.
- ■ Apply an antimicrobial within 1 hour of birth.
- → either 1% silver nitrate drops or 2.5% povidone iodine drops or 1% tetracycline ointment.
- ■ DO NOT wash away the eye antimicrobial.
- ■ If blood or meconium, wipe off with wet cloth and dry.
- ■ DO NOT remove vernix or bathe the baby.
- ■ Continue keeping the baby warm and in skin-to-skin contact with the mother.
- ■ Encourage the mother to initiate breastfeeding when baby shows signs of readiness. Offer her help.
- ■ DO NOT give artificial teats or pre-lacteal feeds to the newborn: no water, sugar water, or local feeds.
- ■ Examine the mother and newborn one hour after delivery of placenta. Use Assess the mother after delivery and Examine the newborn D21

## MONITOR BABY EVERY 15 MINUTES:

- ■ Breathing: listen for grunting, look for chest in-drawing and fast breathing
- ■ Warmth: check to see if feet are cold to touch

<!-- image -->

## INTERVENTIONS, IF REQUIRED

- ■ If pad soaked in less than 5 minutes, or constant trickle of blood, manage as on D22
- ■ If uterus soft, manage as on . B10
- ■ If bleeding from a perineal tear, repair if required or refer to hospital B17 B12

- ■ If breathing with difficulty - grunting, chest in-drawing or fast breathing, examine the baby as on
- ■ If feet are cold to touch or mother and baby are separated:
- → Ensure the room is warm. Cover mother and baby with a blanket
- → Reassess in 1 hour. If still cold, measure temperature. If less than 36.5 0 C, manage as on . If unable to initiate breastfeeding (mother has complications): K9
- → Plan for alternative feeding method . K5-K6
- → If mother HIV+ and chooses replacement feeding, feed accordingly

## ADVISE ON POSTPARTUM CARE

## Advise on postpartum care and hygiene

Advise and explain to the woman:

- ■ To always have someone near her for the first 24 hours to respond to any change in her condition.
- ■ Not to insert anything into the vagina.
- ■ To have enough rest and sleep.
- ■ The importance of washing to prevent infection of the mother and her baby:
- → wash hands before handling baby
- → wash perineum daily and after faecal excretion
- → change perineal pads every 4 to 6 hours, or more frequently if heavy lochia
- → wash used pads or dispose of them safely
- → wash the body daily.
- ■ To avoid sexual intercourse until the perineal wound heals.

## Counsel on nutrition

- ■ Advise the woman to eat a greater amount and variety of healthy foods, such as meat, fish, oils, nuts, seeds, cereals, beans, vegetables, cheese, milk, to help her feel well and strong (give examples of types of food and how much to eat).
- ■ Reassure the mother that she can eat any normal foods - these will not harm the breastfeeding baby.
- ■ Spend more time on nutrition counselling with very thin women and adolescents.
- ■ Determine if there are important taboos about foods which are nutritionally healthy. Advise the woman against these taboos.
- ■ Talk to family members such as partner and mother-in-law, to encourage them to help ensure the woman eats enough and avoids hard physical work.

## Counsel on the importance of family planning

- ■ If appropriate, ask the woman if she would like her partner or another family member to be included in the counselling session.
- ■ Explain that after birth, if she has sex and is not exclusively breastfeeding, she can become pregnant as soon as 4 weeks after delivery.Therefore it is important to start thinking early about what family planning method they will use.
- → Ask about plans for having more children. If she (and her partner) want more children, advise that waiting at least 2-3 years between pregnancies is healthier for the mother and child.
- → Information on when to start a method after delivery will vary depending on whether a woman is breastfeeding or not.
- → Make arrangements for the woman to see a family planning counsellor, or counsel her directly (see the Decision-making tool for family planning providers and clients for information on methods and on the counselling process).
- ■ Advise the correct and consistent use of condoms for dual protection from sexually transmitted infection (STI) or HIV and pregnancy .Promote their use,especially if at risk for sexually transmitted infection (STI) or HIV G2
- ■ For HIV-positive women, see for family planning considerations G4
- ■ Her partner can decide to have a vasectomy (male sterilization) at any time.

## PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION ON HIV

## What is HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and how is HIV transmitted?

- ■ HIV is a virus that destroys parts of the body's immune system.A person infected with HIV may not feel sick at first, but slowly the body's immune system is destroyed. The person becomes ill and unable to fight infection. Once a person is infected with HIV, she or he can give the virus to others.
- ■ HIV can be transmitted through:
- → Exchange of HIV-infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal fluid or blood during unprotected sexual intercourse.
- → HIV-infected blood transfusions or contaminated needles.
- → Sharing of instruments and needles for drug abuse or tattoos.
- → From an infected mother to her child (MTCT) during:
- → pregnancy
- → labour and delivery
- → postpartum through breastfeeding.
- ■ HIV cannot be transmitted through hugging or mosquito bites.
- ■ A special blood test is done to find out if the person is infected with HIV.

## Advantage of knowing the HIV status in pregnancy

## Knowing the HIV status during pregnancy is important so that the woman can:

- ■ get appropriate medical care and interventions to treat and/or prevent HIV-associated illnesses.
- ■ reduce the risk of transmission of infection to the baby:
- → by taking antiretroviral drugs such as AZT in pregnancy, or niverapine during labour G7
- → by adapting infant feeding practices
- → by adapting birth plan and delivery practices G4
- ■ protect her sexual partner(s) from infection.
- ■ make a choice about future pregnancies.

.

## Counsel on correct and consistent use of condoms

SAFER SEX IS ANY SEXUAL PRACTICE THAT REDUCES THE RISK OF TRANSMITTING HIV AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIs) FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER

## THE BEST PROTECTION IS OBTAINED BY:

- ■ Correct and consistent use of condoms during every sexual act.
- ■ Choosing sexual activities that do not allow semen, fluid from the vagina, or blood to enter the mouth, anus or vagina of the partner, or to touch the skin of the partner where there is an open cut or sore.

## IF THE WOMAN IS HIV-POSITIVE:

- ■ Explain to the woman that she is infected and can transmit the infection to her partner.They should use a condom during every sexual act.
- ■ Explain the importance of avoiding reinfection during pregnancy and breastfeeding.The risk of infecting the baby is higher if the mother is reinfected.
- ■ If her partner's status is unknown, counsel her on the benefits of testing her partner.

## IF THE WOMAN IS HIV-NEGATIVE OR RESULT IS UNKNOWN:

- ■ Explain to her that she is at risk of HIV and that it is important to remain negative during pregnancy and breastfeeding.The risk of infecting the baby is higher if the mother is newly infected.
- ■ If her partner's status is unknown, counsel her on the benefits of testing her partner.
- ■ Make sure she knows how to use condoms and where to get them.

## VOLUNTARY COUNSELLING AND TESTING (VCT)

## Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services

## Explain about VCT services:

- ■ VCT is used to determine the HIV status of an individual.
- ■ Testing is voluntary. The woman has a right to refuse.
- ■ VCT provides an opportunity to learn and accept the HIV status in a confidential environment.
- ■ VCT includes pre-test counselling, blood testing and post-test counselling.

## If VCT is available in your setting and you are trained to do VCT, use national HIV guidelines to provide:

- ■ Pre-test counselling.
- ■ Post-test counselling.
- ■ Infant feeding counselling.

## If VCT is not available in your setting, inform the woman about:

- ■ Where to go.
- ■ How the test is performed.
- ■ How confidentiality is maintained.
- ■ When and how results are given.
- ■ Costs involved.
- ■ Address of VCT service in your area:

## Discuss confidentiality of the result

- ■ Assure the woman that her test result is confidential.
- ■ Her result will be shared only with herself and any individual chosen by her.
- ■ She has a right not to disclose her results.

## Implications of test result

- ■ Although the woman will have been counselled at the VCT site, she may need further counselling and support from the health worker who referred her for testing.
- ■ Ask the woman if she is willing to disclose the result. Reassure her that you will keep the result confidential.

## IF TEST RESULT IS POSITIVE:

- ■ Explain to the woman that a positive test result means that she is carrying the infection and has (40%) possibility of transmitting the infection to her unborn child without any intervention.

## IF TEST RESULT IS NEGATIVE:

- ■ Explain to the woman that a negative result can mean either that she is not infected with HIV, or that she is infected with HIV but has not yet made antibodies against the virus (this is sometimes called the 'window' period). Repeat HIV-testing can be offered after 3 months.
- ■ Counsel on the importance of staying negative by correct and consistent use of condoms.

## IF THE WOMAN HAS NOT BEEN TESTED OR DOES NOT DISCLOSE THE RESULT:

- ■ Assure her that you would keep the result confidential if she were to disclose it.
- ■ Reinforce the importance of testing and the benefits of knowing the result

<!-- image -->

## Benefits of involving and testing the male partner(s)

Men are generally the decision-makers in the family and community. Involving them will:

- ■ Have greater impact on the increasing acceptance of condom use and practice of safer sex to avoid infection or unwanted pregnancy.
- ■ Help to decrease the risk of suspicion and violence.
- ■ Help to increase support to their partners.
- ■ Encourage the woman to motivate her partner(s) to be tested.

## CARE AND COUNSELLING ON FAMILY PLANNING FOR THE HIV-POSITIVE WOMAN

## Additional care for the HIV-positive woman

- ■ Determine how much the woman has told her partner, labour companion and family, then respect this confidentiality.
- ■ Be sensitive to her special concerns and fears. Give psychosocial support
- ■ Advise on the importance of good nutrition C16 D26

.

<!-- image -->

- ■ Use universal precautions as for all women . A4
- ■ Advise her that she is more prone to infections and should seek medical help as soon as possible if she has:
- → fever
- → persistent diarrhoea
- → cold and cough - respiratory infections
- → burning urination
- → vaginal itching/foul-smelling discharge
- → severe weight loss
- → skin infections
- → foul-smelling lochia.

<!-- image -->

## DURING PREGNANCY:

- ■ Revise the birth plan . C13 C2
- → Advise her to deliver in a facility.
- → Advise her to go to a facility as soon as her membranes rupture or labour starts.
- ■ Counsel her on antiretroviral prophylactic treatment
- ■ Discuss the infant feeding plan . G8-G9
- ■ Modify preventive treatment for malaria, according to national strategy . F4
- ■ Use universal precautions as for all women . A4

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD:

- ■ Tell her that lochia can cause infection in other people and therefore she should dispose of blood stained sanitary pads safely (list local options).
- ■ If not breastfeeding exclusively, advise her to use a family planning method immediately . D27
- ■ If not breastfeeding, advise her on breast care

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

.

<!-- image -->

## Counsel the HIV-positive woman on family planning

<!-- image -->

- ■ Use the advice and counselling sections on during antenatal care and during postpartum visits. The following advice should be highlighted: D27 C15
- → Explain to the woman that future pregnancies can have significant health risks for her and her baby. These include: transmission of HIV to the baby (during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding), miscarriage, preterm labour, stillbirth, low birth weight, ectopic pregnancy and other complications.
- → If she wants more children, advise her that waiting at least 2-3 years between pregnancies is healthier for her and the baby.
- → A family planning method needs to be chosen to protect from pregnancy and from infection with other sexually transmitted infections (STI) or HIV reinfection, and prevent transmission of STI or HIV to her partner. Condoms are the best option for the woman with HIV.
- ■ Advise the woman on correct and consistent use of condoms . G4
- ■ With the condom, another family planning method can be used for additional protection against pregnancy. However, not all methods are appropriate for the HIV-positive woman:
- → Given the woman's HIV status, she may not choose to exclusively breastfeed, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) may not be a suitable method.
- → Intrauterine device (IUD) use is only recommended if other methods are not available or acceptable.
- → Fertility awareness methods may be difficult if the woman has AIDS or is on treatment for HIV infections due to changes in the menstrual cycle and elevated temperatures.
- → If the woman is taking pills for tuberculosis (rifampin), she usually cannot use contraceptive pills, monthly injectables or implants.

The family planning counsellor will provide more information.

## SUPPORT TO THE HIV-POSITIVE WOMAN

Pregnant women who are HIV-positive benefit greatly from the following support after the first impact of the test result has been overcome. Special training is required to counsel HIV-positive women and this guide does not substitute for special training. However, if a trained counsellor is not available or the woman will not seek the help of a trained counsellor, advise her as follows:

## Provide emotional support to the woman

- ■ Empathize with her concerns and fears.
- ■ Use good counselling skills . A2
- ■ Help her to assess her situation and decide which is the best option for her, her (unborn) child and her sexual partner. Support her choice.
- ■ Connect her with other existing support services including support groups, income-generating activities, religious support groups, orphan care, home care.
- ■ Help her to find ways to involve her partner and/or extended family members in sharing responsibility, to identify a figure from the community who will support and care for her.
- ■ Discuss how to provide for the other children and help her identify a figure from the extended family or community who will support her children.
- ■ Confirm and support information given during VCT on mother-to-child transmission, the possibility of ARV treatment, safer sex, infant feeding and family planning advice (help her to absorb the information and apply it in her own case).
- ■ If the woman has signs of AIDS and/or of terminal illness, respond. Refer her to appropriate services.

## How to provide support

- ■ Conduct peer support groups for women who have tested HIV-positive and couples affected by HIV/AIDS:
- → Led by a social worker and/or woman who has come to terms with her own HIV-positive status.
- → Held outside the clinic in order to not reveal the HIV status of the woman involved.
- ■ Establish and maintain constant linkages with other health, social and community workers support services:
- → To exchange information for the coordination of interventions
- → To make a plan for each family involved.
- ■ Refer individuals or couples for counselling by community counsellors.

## PREVENT MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION (MTCT) OF HIV

## Give antiretroviral (ARV) drug to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV

- ■ Explain to the pregnant woman that the drug has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of infection of the baby.
- ■ Explain to her that to receive ARV prophylactic treatment, she must:
- → attend antenatal care regularly
- → know her HIV status
- → be counselled on infant feeding
- → deliver with a skilled attendant preferably in a hospital
- → be able and willing to take drugs as prescribed.
- ■ If treatment with zidovudine (ZDV, AZT) is planned:
- → obtain a haemoglobin determination early; if less than 8 g/dl, treat anaemia urgently and remeasure to assure adequate level for treatment.
- → determine when woman will be at 36 weeks gestation and explain to her  when to start treatment.
- ■ Supply her with enough tablets for the beginning of labour, in case of any delay in reaching the hospital or clinic.
- ■ Tell her to take the labour dose of the drug as soon as labour starts and show her how to take it.

## COUNSEL ON INFANT FEEDING CHOICE

Special training is required to counsel an HIV-positive mother about infant feeding choices and to support her chosen method. This guide does not substitute for special training. HIV-positive women should be referred to a health worker trained in infant-feeding counselling. However, if a trained counsellor is not available, or the woman will not seek the help of a trained counsellor, counsel her as follows.

## Explain the risks of HIV transmission through breastfeeding and not breastfeeding

- ■ Five out of 20 babies born to known HIV-positive mothers will be infected during pregnancy and delivery without ARV medication.Three more may be infected by breastfeeding.
- ■ The risk may be reduced if the baby is breastfed exclusively using good technique, so that the breasts stay healthy.
- ■ Mastitis and nipple fissures increase the risk that the baby will be infected.
- ■ The risk of not breastfeeding may be much higher because replacement feeding carries risks too:
- → diarrhoea because of contamination from unclean water, unclean utensils or because the milk is left out too long.
- → malnutrition because of insufficient quantity given to the baby, the milk is too watery, or because of recurrent episodes of diarrhoea.
- ■ Mixed feeding may also increase the risk of HIV transmission and diarrhoea.

## If a woman has unknown HIV status

- ■ Counsel on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding K2
- ■ Encourage exclusive breastfeeding.
- ■ Counsel on the need to know the HIV status and where to go for VCT G3
- ■ Explain to her the risks of HIV transmission:
- → even in areas where many women have HIV, most women are negative
- → the risk of infecting the baby is higher if the mother is newly infected
- → explain that it is very important to avoid  infection during pregnancy and the breastfeeding period.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## If a woman knows and accepts that she is HIV-positive

- ■ Inform her about the options for feeding, the advantages and risks:
- → If acceptable, feasible, safe and sustainable (affordable), she might choose replacement feeding with home-prepared formula or commercial formula.
- → Exclusive breastfeeding, stopping as soon as replacement feeding is possible. If replacement feeding is introduced early, she must stop breastfeeding.
- → Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, then continued breastfeeding plus complementary feeding after 6 months of age, as recommended for HIV-negative women and women who do not know their status.
- ■ In some situations additional possibilities are:
- → expressing and heat-treating her breast milk
- → wet nursing by an HIV-negative woman.
- ■ Help her to assess her situation and decide which is the best option for her, and support her choice.
- ■ If the mother chooses breastfeeding, give her special advice.
- ■ Make sure the mother understands that if she chooses replacement feeding this includes enriched complementary feeding up to 2 years.
- → If this cannot be ensured, exclusive breastfeeding, stopping early when replacement feeding is feasible, is an alternative.
- → All babies receiving replacement feeding need regular follow-up, and their mothers need support to provide correct replacement feeding.

## IF THE MOTHER CHOOSES REPLACEMENT FEEDING

## Teach the mother replacement feeding

- ■ Ask the mother what kind of replacement feeding she chose.
- ■ For the first few feeds after delivery, prepare the formula for the mother, then teach her how to prepare the formula and feed the baby by cup:
- → Wash hands with water and soap
- → Boil the water for few minutes
- → Clean the cup thoroughly with water, soap and, if possible, boil or pour boiled water in it
- → Decide how much milk the baby needs from the instructions
- → Measure the milk and water and mix them
- → Teach the mother how to feed the baby by cup K9
- → Let the mother feed the baby 8 times a day (in the first month).Teach her to be flexible and respond to the baby's demands
- → If the baby does not finish the feed within 1 hour of preparation, give it to an older child or add to cooking. DO NOT give the milk to the baby for the next feed
- → Wash the utensils with water and soap soon after feeding the baby
- → Make a new feed every time.
- ■ Give her written instructions on safe preparation of formula.
- ■ Explain the risks of replacement feeding and how to avoid them.
- ■ Advise when to seek care.
- ■ Advise about the follow-up visit.

<!-- image -->

## Explain the risks of replacement feeding

- ■ Her baby may get diarrhoea if:
- → hands, water, or utensils are not clean
- → the milk stands out too long.
- ■ Her baby may not grow well if:
- → s/he receives too little formula each feed or too few feeds
- → the milk is too watery
- → s/he has diarrhoea.

## Follow-up for replacement feeding

- ■ Ensure regular follow-up visits for growth monitoring.
- ■ Ensure the support to provide safe replacement feeding.
- ■ Advise the mother to return if:
- → the baby is feeding less than 6 times, or is taking smaller quantities
- → the baby has diarrhoea
- → there are other danger signs.

## Give special counselling to the mother who is HIV-positive and chooses breastfeeding

- ■ Support the mother in her choice of breastfeeding.
- ■ Ensure good attachment and suckling to prevent mastitis and nipple damage . K3
- ■ Advise the mother to return immediately if:
- → she has any breast symptoms or signs
- → the baby has any difficulty feeding.
- ■ Ensure a visit in the first week to assess attachment and positioning and the condition of the mother's breasts.
- ■ Arrange for further counselling to prepare for the possibility of stopping breastfeeding early.
- ■ Give psychosocial support . G6

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN MANAGING THE PREGNANT ADOLESCENT

Special training is required to work with adolescent girls and this guide does not substitute for special training.

However, when working with an adolescent, whether married or unmarried, it is particularly important to remember the following.

## When interacting with the adolescent

- ■ Do not be judgemental.You should be aware of, and overcome, your own discomfort with adolescent sexuality.
- ■ Encourage the girl to ask questions and tell her that all topics can be discussed.
- ■ Use simple and clear language.
- ■ Repeat guarantee of confidentiality A2

.

- ■ Understand adolescent difficulties in communicating about topics related to sexuality (fears of parental discovery, adult disapproval, social stigma, etc).

Support her when discussing her situation and ask if she has any particular concerns:

- ■ Does she live with her parents, can she confide in them? Does she live as a couple? Is she in a longterm relationship? Has she been subject to violence or coercion?
- ■ Determine who knows about this pregnancy - she may not have revealed it openly.
- ■ Support her concerns related to puberty, social acceptance, peer pressure, forming relationships, social stigmas and violence.

## Help the girl consider her options and to make decisions which best suit her needs.

- ■ Birth planning: delivery in a hospital or health centre is highly recommended. She needs to understand why this is important, she needs to decide if she will do it and and how she will arrange it.
- ■ Prevention of STI or HIV/AIDS is important for her and her baby. If she or her partner are at risk of STI or HIV/AIDS, they should use a condom in all sexual relations. She may need advice on how to discuss condom use with her partner.
- ■ Spacing of the next pregnancy - for both the woman and baby's health, it is recommended that any next pregnancy be spaced by at least 2 or 3 years.The girl, with her partner if applicable, needs to decide if and when a second pregnancy is desired, based on their plans. Healthy adolescents can safely use any contraceptive method.The girl needs support in knowing her options and in deciding which is best for her. Be active in providing family planning counselling and advice.

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUPPORTING THE WOMAN LIVING WITH VIOLENCE

Violence against women by their intimate partners affects women's physical and mental health, including their reproductive health.While you may not have been trained to deal with this problem, women may disclose violence to you or you may see unexplained bruises and other injuries which make you suspect she may be suffering abuse. The following are some recommendations on how to respond and support her.

## Support the woman living with violence

- ■ Provide a space where the woman can speak to you in privacy where her partner or others cannot hear. Do all you can to guarantee confidentiality, and reassure her of this.
- ■ Gently encourage her to tell you what is happening to her.You may ask indirect questions to help her tell her story.
- ■ Listen to her in a sympathetic manner. Listening can often be of great support. Do not blame her or make a joke of the situation. She may defend her partner's action. Reassure her that she does not deserve to be abused in any way.
- ■ Help her to assess her present situation. If she thinks she or her children are in danger, explore together the options to ensure her immediate safety (e.g. can she stay with her parents or friends? Does she have, or could she borrow, money?)
- ■ Explore her options with her. Help her identify local sources of support, either within her family, friends, and local community or through NGOs, shelters or social services, if available. Remind her that she has legal recourse, if relevant.
- ■ Offer her an opportunity to see you again.Violence by partners is complex, and she may be unable to resolve her situation quickly.
- ■ Document any forms of abuse identified or concerns you may have in the file.

## Support the health service response to needs of women living with violence

- ■ Help raise awareness among health care staff about violence against women and its prevalence in the community the clinic serves.
- ■ Find out what if training is available to improve the support that health care staff can provide to those women who may need it.
- ■ Display posters, leaflets and other information that condemn violence, and information on groups that can provide support.
- ■ Make contact with organizations working to address violence in your area. Identify those that can provide support for women in abusive relationships. If specific services are not available, contact other groups such as churches, women's groups, elders, or other local groups and discuss with them support they can provide or other what roles they can play, like resolving disputes. Ensure you have a list of these resources available.

## COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR MATERNAL AND NEWBORN HEALTH

<!-- image -->

- ■ Everyone in the community should be informed and involved in the process of improving the health of their community members.This section provides guidance on how their involvement can help improve the health of women and newborns.
- ■ Different groups should be asked to give feedback and suggestions on how to improve the services the health facilities provide.
- ■ Use the following suggestions when working with families and communities to support the care of women and newborns during pregnancy, delivery, post-abortion and postpartum periods.

## ESTABLISH LINKS

## Coordinate with other health care providers and community groups

- ■ Meet with others in the community to discuss and agree messages related to pregnancy, delivery, postpartum and post-abortion care of women and newborns.
- ■ Work together with leaders and community groups to discuss the most common health problems and find solutions. Groups to contact and establish relations which include:
- → other health care providers
- → traditional birth attendants and healers
- → maternity waiting homes
- → adolescent health services
- → schools
- → nongovernmental organizations
- → breastfeeding support groups
- → district health committees
- → women's groups
- → agricultural associations
- → neighbourhood committees
- → youth groups
- → church groups.
- ■ Establish links with peer support groups and referral sites for women with special needs, including women living with HIV, adolescents and women living with violence. Have available the names and contact information for these groups and referral sites, and encourage the woman to seek their support.

## Establish links with traditional birth attendants and traditional healers

- ■ Contact traditional birth attendants and healers who are working in the health facility's catchment area. Discuss how you can support each other.
- ■ Respect their knowledge, experience and influence in the community.
- ■ Share with them the information you have and listen to their opinions on this. Provide copies of health education materials that you distribute to community members and discuss the content with them. Have them explain knowledge that they share with the community.Together you can create new knowledge which is more locally appropriate.
- ■ Review how together you can provide support to women, families and groups for maternal and newborn health.
- ■ Involve TBAs and healers in counselling sessions in which advice is given to families and other community members. Include TBAs in meetings with community leaders and groups.
- ■ Discuss the recommendation that all deliveries should be performed by a skilled birth attendant. When not possible or not preferred by the woman and her family, discuss the requirements for safer delivery at home, postpartum care, and when to seek emergency care.
- ■ Invite TBAs to act as labour companions for women they have followed during pregnancy, if this is the woman's wish.
- ■ Make sure TBAs are included in the referral system.
- ■ Clarify how and when to refer, and provide TBAs with feedback on women they have referred.

## INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY IN QUALITY OF SERVICES

All in the community should be informed and involved in the process of improving the health of their members. Ask the different groups to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve the services the health facility provides.

- ■ Find out what people know about maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity in their locality. Share data you may have and reflect together on why these deaths and illnesses may occur. Discuss with them what families and communities can do to prevent these deaths and illnesses.Together prepare an action plan, defining responsibilities.
- ■ Discuss the different health messages that you provide. Have the community members talk about their knowledge in relation to these messages.Together determine what families and communities can do to support maternal and newborn health.
- ■ Discuss some practical ways in which families and others in the community can support women during pregnancy, post-abortion, delivery and postpartum periods:
- → Recognition of and rapid response to emergency/danger signs during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum periods
- → Provision of food and care for children and other family members when the woman needs to be away from home during delivery, or when she needs to rest
- → Accompanying the woman after delivery
- → Support for payment of fees and supplies
- → Motivation of male partners to help with the workload, accompany the woman to the clinic, allow her to rest and ensure she eats properly. Motivate communication between males and their partners, including discussing postpartum family planning needs.
- ■ Support the community in preparing an action plan to respond to emergencies. Discuss the following with them:
- → Emergency/danger signs - knowing when to seek care
- → Importance of rapid response to emergencies to reduce mother and newborn death, disability and illness
- → Transport options available, giving examples of how transport can be organized
- → Reasons for delays in seeking care and possible difficulties, including heavy rains
- → What services are available and where
- → What options are available
- → Costs and options for payment
- → A plan of action for responding in emergencies, including roles and responsibilities.

## COUNSEL ON BREASTFEEDING

## Counsel on importance of exclusive breastfeeding during pregnancy and after birth

## INCLUDE PARTNER OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS IF POSSIBLE

## Explain to the mother that:

- ■ Breast milk contains exactly the nutrients a baby needs
- → is easily digested and efficiently used by the baby's body
- → protects a baby against infection.
- ■ Babies should start breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth. They should not have any other food or drink before they start to breastfeed.
- ■ Babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life.
- ■ Breastfeeding
- → helps baby's development and mother/baby attachment
- → can help delay a new pregnancy (see for breastfeeding and family planning). D27

For counselling if mother HIV-positive, see

.

<!-- image -->

## Help the mother to initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour, when baby is ready

- ■ After birth, let the baby rest comfortably on the mother's chest in skin-to-skin contact.
- ■ Tell the mother to help the baby to her breast when the baby seems to be ready, usually within the first hour. Signs of readiness to breastfeed are:
- → baby looking around/moving
- → mouth open
- → searching.
- ■ Check that position and attachment are correct at the first feed. Offer to help the mother at any time . K3
- ■ Let the baby release the breast by her/himself; then offer the second breast.
- ■ If the baby does not feed in 1 hour, examine the baby . If healthy , leave the baby with the mother to try later. Assess in 3 hours, or earlier if the baby is small . J4 J2-J9
- ■ If the mother is ill and unable to breastfeed, help her to express breast milk and feed the baby by cup . On day 1 express in a spoon and feed by spoon. K6
- ■ If mother cannot breastfeed at all, use one of the following options:
- → home-made or commercial formula
- → donated heat-treated breast milk.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Support exclusive breastfeeding

- ■ Keep the mother and baby together in bed or within easy reach. DO NOT separate them.
- ■ Encourage breastfeeding on demand, day and night, as long as the baby wants.
- → A baby needs to feed day and night, 8 or more times in 24 hours from birth. Only on the first day may a full-term baby sleep many hours after a good feed.
- → A small baby should be encouraged to feed, day and night, at least 8 times in 24 hours from birth.
- ■ Help the mother whenever she wants, and especially if she is a first time or adolescent mother.
- ■ Let baby release the breast, then offer the second breast.
- ■ If mother must be absent, let her express breast milk and let somebody else feed the expressed breast milk to the baby by cup.

DO NOT force the baby to take the breast.

DO NOT interrupt feed before baby wants.

DO NOT give any other feeds or water.

DO NOT use artificial teats or pacifiers.

- ■ Advise the mother on medication and breastfeeding
- → Most drugs given to the mother in this guide are safe and the baby can be breastfed.
- → If mother is taking cotrimoxazole or fansidar, monitor baby for jaundice.

<!-- image -->

## Teach correct positioning and attachment for breastfeeding

- ■ Show the mother how to hold her baby. She should:
- → make sure the baby's head and body are in a straight line
- → make sure the baby is facing the breast, the baby's nose is opposite her nipple
- → hold the baby's body close to her body
- → support the baby's whole body, not just the neck and shoulders
- ■ Show the mother how to help her baby to attach. She should:
- → touch her baby's lips with her nipple
- → wait until her baby's mouth is opened wide
- → move her baby quickly onto her breast, aiming the infant's lower lip well below the nipple.
- ■ Look for signs of good attachment and effective suckling (that is, slow, deep sucks, sometimes pausing). If the attachment or suckling is not good, try again. Then reassess.
- ■ If breast engorgement, express a small amount of breast milk before starting breastfeeding to soften nipple area so that it is easier for the baby to attach.

## COUNSEL ON BREASTFEEDING

## Give special support to breastfeed the small baby (preterm and/or low birth weight)

## COUNSEL THE MOTHER:

- ■ Reassure the mother that she can breastfeed her small baby and she has enough milk.
- ■ Explain that her milk is the best food for such a small baby. Feeding for her/him is even more important than for a big baby.
- ■ Explain how the milk's appearance changes: milk in the first days is thick and yellow, then it becomes thinner and whiter. Both are good for the baby.
- ■ A small baby does not feed as well as a big baby in the first days:
- → may tire easily and suck weakly at first
- → may suckle for shorter periods before resting
- → may fall asleep during feeding
- → may have long pauses between suckling and may feed longer
- → does not always wake up for feeds.
- ■ Explain that breastfeeding will become easier if the baby suckles and stimulates the breast her/himself and when the baby becomes bigger.
- ■ Encourage skin-to-skin contact since it makes breastfeeding easier.

## HELP THE MOTHER:

- ■ Initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth.
- ■ Feed the baby every 2-3 hours.Wake the baby for feeding, even if she/he does not wake up alone, 2 hours after the last feed.
- ■ Always start the feed with breastfeeding before offering a cup. If necessary, improve the milk flow (let the mother express a little breast milk before attaching the baby to the breast).
- ■ Keep the baby longer at the breast.Allow long pauses or long, slow feed. Do not interrupt feed if the baby is still trying.
- ■ If the baby is not yet suckling well and long enough, do whatever works better in your setting:
- → Let the mother express breast milk into baby's mouth . K5
- → Let the mother express breast milk and feed baby by cup . On the first day express breast milk into, and feed colostrum by spoon. K6
- ■ Teach the mother to observe swallowing if giving expressed breast milk.
- ■ Weigh the baby daily (if accurate and precise scales available), record and assess weight gain

## Give special support to breastfeed twins

## COUNSEL THE MOTHER:

- ■ Reassure the mother that she has enough breast milk for two babies.
- ■ Encourage her that twins may take longer to establish breastfeeding since they are frequently born preterm and with low birth weight.

## HELP THE MOTHER:

- ■ Start feeding one baby at a time until breastfeeding is well established.
- ■ Help the mother find the best method to feed the twins:
- → If one is weaker, encourage her to make sure that the weaker twin gets enough milk.
- → If necessary, she can express milk for her/him and feed her/him by cup after initial breastfeeding.
- → Daily alternate the side each baby is offered.

## ALTERNATIVE FEEDING METHODS

## Express breast milk

- ■ The mother needs clean containers to collect and store the milk. A wide necked jug, jar, bowl or cup can be used.
- ■ Once expressed, the milk should be stored with a well-fitting lid or cover.
- ■ Teach the mother to express breast milk:
- → To provide milk for the baby when she is away.To feed the baby if the baby is small and too weak to suckle
- → To relieve engorgement and to help baby to attach
- → To drain the breast when she has severe mastitis or abscesses.
- ■ Teach the mother to express her milk by herself. DO NOT do it for her.
- ■ Teach her how to:
- → Wash her hands thoroughly.
- → Sit or stand comfortably and hold a clean container underneath her breast.
- → Put her first finger and thumb on either side of the areola, behind the nipple.
- → Press slightly inwards towards the breast between her finger and thumb.
- → Express one side until the milk flow slows. Then express the other side.
- → Continue alternating sides for at least 20-30 minutes.
- ■ If milk does not flow well:
- → Apply warm compresses.
- → Have someone massage her back and neck before expressing.
- → Teach the mother breast and nipple massage.
- → Feed the baby by cup immediately. If not, store expressed milk in a cool, clean and safe place.
- ■ If necessary, repeat the procedure to express breast milk at least 8 times in 24 hours. Express as much as the baby would take or more, every 3 hours.
- ■ When not breastfeeding at all, express just a little to relieve pain
- ■ If mother is very ill, help her to express or do it for her.

## Hand express breast milk directly into the baby's mouth

- ■ Teach the mother to express breast milk.
- ■ Hold the baby in skin-to-skin contact, the mouth close to the nipple.
- ■ Express the breast until some drops of breast milk appear on the nipple.
- ■ Wait until the baby is alert and opens mouth and eyes, or stimulate the baby lightly to awaken her/him.
- ■ Let the baby smell and lick the nipple, and attempt to suck.
- ■ Let some breast milk fall into the baby's mouth.
- ■ Wait until the baby swallows before expressing more drops of breast milk.
- ■ After some time, when the baby has had enough, she/he will close her/his mouth and take no more breast milk.
- ■ Ask the mother to repeat this process every 1-2 hours if the baby is very small (or every 2-3 hours if the baby is not very small).
- ■ Be flexible at each feed, but make sure the intake is adequate by checking daily weight gain.

## ALTERNATIVE FEEDING METHODS

## Cup feeding expressed breast milk

- ■ Teach the mother to feed the baby with a cup. Do not feed the baby yourself.The mother should:
- ■ Measure the quantity of milk in the cup
- ■ Hold the baby sitting semi-upright on her lap
- ■ Hold the cup of milk to the baby's lips:
- → rest cup lightly on lower lip
- → touch edge of cup to outer part of upper lip
- → tip cup so that milk just reaches the baby's lips
- → but do not pour the milk into the baby's mouth.
- ■ Baby becomes alert, opens mouth and eyes, and starts to feed.
- ■ The baby will suck the milk, spilling some.
- ■ Small babies will start to take milk into their mouth using the tongue.
- ■ Baby swallows the milk.
- ■ Baby finishes feeding when mouth closes or when not interested in taking more.
- ■ If the baby does not take the calculated amount:
- → Feed for a longer time or feed more often
- → Teach the mother to measure the baby's intake over 24 hours, not just at each feed.
- ■ If mother does not express enough milk in the first few days, or if the mother cannot breastfeed at all, use one of the following feeding options:
- → donated heat-treated breast milk
- → home-made or commercial formula.
- ■ Feed the baby by cup if the mother is not available to do so.
- ■ Baby is cup feeding well if required amount of milk is swallowed, spilling little, and weight gain is maintained.

## Quantity to feed by cup

- ■ Start with 80 ml/kg body weight per day for day 1. Increase total volume by 10-20 ml/kg per day, until baby takes 150 ml/kg/day. See table below.
- ■ Divide total into 8 feeds. Give every 2-3 hours to a small size or ill baby.
- ■ Check the baby's 24 hour intake. Size of individual feeds may vary.
- ■ Continue until baby takes the required quantity.
- ■ Wash the cup with water and soap after each feed.

## APPROXIMATE QUANTITY TO FEED BY CUP (IN ML) EVERY 2-3 HOURS FROM BIRTH (BY WEIGHT)

| Weight (kg)   | Day 0   | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6     | 7     |
|---------------|---------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1.5-1.9       | 15ml    | 17ml | 19ml | 21ml | 23ml | 25ml  | 27ml  | 27+ml |
| 2.0-2.4       | 20ml    | 22ml | 25ml | 27ml | 30ml | 32ml  | 35ml  | 35+ml |
| 2.5+          | 25ml    | 28ml | 30ml | 35ml | 35ml | 40+ml | 45+ml | 50+ml |

## Signs that baby is receiving adequate amount of milk

- ■ Baby is satisfied with the feed.
- ■ Weight loss is less than 10% in the first week of life.
- ■ Baby gains at least 160g in the following weeks or a minimum 300g in the first month.
- ■ Baby wets every day as frequently as baby is feeding.
- ■ Baby's stool is changing from dark to light brown or yellow by day 3.

## Weigh baby in the first month of life

## WEIGH THE BABY

- ■ Monthly if birth weight normal and breastfeeding well. Every 2 weeks if replacement feeding or treatment with isoniazid.
- ■ When the baby is brought for examination because not feeding well, or ill.

## WEIGH THE SMALL BABY

- ■ Every day until 3 consecutive times gaining weight (at least 15g/day).
- ■ Weekly until 4-6 weeks of age (reached term).

## Assess weight gain

Use this table for guidance when assessing weight gain in the first month of life

| Age       | Acceptable weight loss/gain in the first month of life   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 week    | Loss up to 10%                                           |
| 2-4 weeks | Gain at least 160 g per week (at least 15 g/day)         |
| 1 month   | Gain at least 300 g in the first month                   |

## If weighing daily with a precise and accurate scale

| First week   | No weight loss or total less than 10%    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Afterward    | daily gain in small babies at least 20 g |

## Scale maintenance

Daily/weekly weighing requires precise and accurate scale (10g increment):

- → Calibrate it daily according to instructions.
- → Check it for accuracy according to instructions.

Simple spring scales are not precise enough for daily/weekly weighing.

## OTHER BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT

## Give special support to the mother who is not yet breastfeeding

## (Mother or baby ill, or baby too small to suckle)

- ■ Teach the mother to express breast milk . Help her if necessary. K5
- ■ Use the milk to feed the baby by cup.
- ■ If mother and baby are separated, help the mother to see the baby or inform her about the baby's condition at least twice daily.
- ■ If the baby was referred to another institution, ensure the baby gets the mother's expressed breast milk if possible.
- ■ Encourage the mother to breastfeed when she or the baby recovers.

<!-- image -->

## If the baby does not have a mother

- ■ Give donated heat treated breast milk or home-based or commercial formula by cup.
- ■ Teach the carer how to prepare milk and feed the baby . K6
- ■ Follow up in 2 weeks; weigh and assess weight gain.

<!-- image -->

## Advise the mother who is not breastfeeding at all on how to relieve engorgement

## (Baby died or stillborn, mother chose replacement feeding)

- ■ Breasts may be uncomfortable for a while.
- ■ Avoid stimulating the breasts.
- ■ Support breasts with a well-fitting bra or cloth. Do not bind the breasts tightly as this may increase her discomfort.
- ■ Apply a compress.Warmth is comfortable for some mothers, others prefer a cold compress to reduce swelling.
- ■ Teach the mother to express enough milk to relieve discomfort. Expressing can be done a few times a day when the breasts are overfull. It does not need to be done if the mother is uncomfortable. It will be less than her baby would take and will not stimulate increased milk production.
- ■ Relieve pain.An analgesic such as ibuprofen, or paracetamol may be used. Some women use plant products such as teas made from herbs, or plants such as raw cabbage leaves placed directly on the breast to reduce pain and swelling.
- ■ Advise to seek care if breasts become painful, swollen, red, if she feels ill or temperature greater than 38ºC.

## Pharmacological treatments to reduce milk supply are not recommended.

The above methods are considered more effective in the long term.

## LABORATORY TESTS

## Check urine for protein

- ■ Label a clean container.
- ■ Give woman the clean container and explain where she can urinate.
- ■ Teach woman how to collect a clean-catch urine sample. Ask her to:
- → Clean vulva with water
- → Spread labia with fingers
- → Urinate freely (urine should not dribble over vulva; this will ruin sample)
- → Catch the middle part of the stream of urine in the cup. Remove container before urine stops.
- ■ Analyse urine for protein using either dipstick or boiling method.

## DIPSTICK METHOD

- ■ Dip coated end of paper dipstick in urine sample.
- ■ Shake off excess by tapping against side of container.
- ■ Wait specified time (see dipstick instructions).
- ■ Compare with colour chart on label. Colours range from yellow (negative) through yellow-green and green-blue for positive.

## BOILING METHOD

- ■ Put urine in test tube and boil top half. Boiled part may become cloudy.After boiling allow the test tube to stand.A thick precipitate at the bottom of the tube indicates protein.
- ■ Add 2-3 drops of 2-3% acetic acid after boiling the urine (even if urine is not cloudy)
- → If the urine remains cloudy, protein is present in the urine.
- → If cloudy urine becomes clear, protein is not present.
- → If boiled urine was not cloudy to begin with, but becomes cloudy when acetic acid is added, protein is present.

## Check haemoglobin

- ■ Draw blood with syringe and needle or a sterile lancet.
- ■ Insert below instructions for method used locally.

## Perform rapid plasmareagin (RPR) test for syphilis

- ■ Seek consent.
- ■ Explain procedure.
- ■ Use a sterile needle and syringe. Draw up 5 ml blood from a vein. Put in a clear test tube.
- ■ Let test tube sit 20 minutes to allow serum to separate (or centrifuge 3-5 minutes at 2000-3000 rpm). In the separated sample, serum will be on top.
- ■ Use sampling pipette to withdraw some of the serum. Take care not to include any red blood cells from the lower part of the separated sample.
- ■ Hold the pipette vertically over a test card circle. Squeeze teat to allow one drop (50µl) of serum to fall onto a circle. Spread the drop to fill the circle using a toothpick or other clean spreader.

Important: Several samples may be tested on one card. Be careful not to contaminate the remaining test circles. Use a clean spreader for every sample. Carefully label each sample with a patient's name or number.

- ■ Attach dispensing needle to a syringe. Shake antigen.* Draw up enough antigen for the number of tests to be done (one drop per test).
- ■ Holding the syringe vertically, allow exactly one drop of antigen (20µl) to fall onto each test sample. DO NOT stir.
- ■ Rotate the test card smoothly on the palm of the hand for 8 minutes.** (Or rotate on a mechanical rotator.)
* Make sure antigen was refrigerated (not frozen) and has not expired.
- ** Room temperature should be 73º-85ºF (22.8º-29.3ºC).

## Interpreting results

- ■ After 8 minutes rotation, inspect the card in good light. Turn or tilt the card to see whether there is clumping (reactive result). Most test cards include negative and positive control circles for comparison.
1. Non-reactive (no clumping or only slight roughness) - Negative for syphilis
2. Reactive (highly visible clumping) - Positive for syphilis
3. Weakly reactive (minimal clumping) - Positive for syphilis

NOTE:  Weakly reactive can also be more finely granulated and difficult to see than in this illustration.

## When to seek care for danger signs

Go to hospital or health centre immediately, day or night, DO NOT wait, if your baby has any of the following signs:

- ■ Difficulty breathing
- ■ Fits
- ■ Fever
- ■ Feels cold
- ■ Bleeding
- ■ Stops feeding
- ■ Diarrhoea.

- ■ Difficulty feeding.
- ■ Feeds less than every 5 hours.
- ■ Pus coming from the eyes.
- ■ Irritated cord with pus or blood.
- ■ Yellow eyes or skin.

## BREASTFEEDING

## Breastfeeding has many advantages

## FOR THE BABY

- ■ During the first 6 months of life, the baby needs nothing more than breast milk - not water, not other milk, not cereals, not teas, not juices.
- ■ Breast milk contains exactly the water and nutrients that a baby's body needs. It is easily digested and efficiently used by the baby's body. It helps protect against infections and allergies and helps the baby's growth and development.

## FOR THE MOTHER

- ■ Postpartum bleeding can be reduced due to uterine contractions caused by the baby's sucking.
- ■ Breastfeeding can help delay a new pregnancy.

FOR THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF LIFE, GIVE ONLY BREAST MILK TO YOUR BABY, DAY AND NIGHT AS OFTEN AND AS LONG AS SHE/HE WANTS.

## Suggestions for successful breastfeeding

- ■ Immediately after birth, keep your baby in the bed with you, or within easy reach.
- ■ Start breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth.
- ■ The baby's suck stimulates your milk production.The more the baby feeds, the more milk you will produce.
- ■ At each feeding, let the baby feed and release your breast, and then offer your second breast.At the next feeding, alternate and begin with the second breast.
- ■ Give your baby the first milk (colostrum). It is nutritious and has antibodies to help keep your baby healthy.
- ■ At night, let your baby sleep with you, within easy reach.
- ■ While breastfeeding, you should drink plenty of clean, safe water. You should eat more and healthier foods and rest when you can.

<!-- image -->

## The health worker can support you in starting and maintaining breastfeeding

- ■ The health worker can help you to correctly position the baby and ensure she/he attaches to the breast. This will reduce breast problems for the mother.
- ■ The health worker can show you how to express milk from your breast with your hands. If you should need to leave the baby with another caretaker for short periods, you can leave your milk and it can be given to the baby in a cup.
- ■ The health worker can put you in contact with a breastfeeding support group.

If you have any difficulties with breastfeeding, see the health worker immediately.

## Breastfeeding and family planning

- ■ During the first 6 months after birth, if you breastfeed exclusively, day and night, and your menstruation has not returned, you are protected against another pregnancy.
- ■ If you do not meet these requirements, or if you wish to use another family planning method while breastfeeding, discuss the different options available with the health worker.
