## Appointments

During your pregnancy, you will be seen for many appointments. Each pregnancy is unique, so your schedule may be different from someone else's. Always arrive 10 minutes before your appointment.

You will meet with our financial advisor at one of your 1st in-person visits to review insurance.

Each appointment with your provider will involve checking your blood pressure, weight, listening to the baby's heart tones, checking growth of baby and discussing any questions you may have.

| Nurse Visit (virtual or in-person)   | The first visit with the prenatal nurse will involve sharing information regarding your health and past pregnancies.

## Understanding Your OB Ultrasound

Fetal ultrasound images can help your provider evaluate your baby's growth and development.

A dating ultrasound will be done around 10 weeks gestation to verify your due date. There is no preparation for this exam.

In early pregnancy (6-10 weeks), if there is a suspected problem, a transvaginal ultrasound may be performed. A vaginal transducer is placed in your vagina allowing the baby and pelvic anatomy to be seen more clearly. There is no preparation for the exam.

A routine fetal anatomy ultrasound is performed around 20 weeks gestation of pregnancy. This will provide information about:

- Age and size of the baby
- Placenta
- Baby's development and anatomy
- All anatomy may not be visualized and it may be necessary to have a follow-up exam in 4 weeks.
- Rule out abnormalities
- If you have a family history of an abnormality or a possible abnormality is suspected on the routine ultrasound, your provider may refer you for a more detailed or Level II ultrasound.

It is necessary to drink 32 oz. of water in preparation for the exam. Please begin to drink water one hour prior to the exam. This helps to define placental position and to check the length of the cervix. Please eat something about 30 minutes prior to the exam as this encourages the baby to move.

This is an exciting and happy time for you and you deserve the best quality medical sonogram. You can assist us in creating an environment that allows the sonographer to focus on you and your baby by helping in the following ways.

- Please limit the number of visitors in the room, including children. We may need to limit the amount of visitors in the exam room.
- Children attending the ultrasound must be accompanied by an adult other than the patient.
- Visitors need to be on time and keep voices down during the exam to ensure the sonographer can give you their undivided attention.
- No cell phone use or any personal videotaping or still photography is allowed during the ultrasound.
- You will be given the results of the ultrasound by your provider.
- You will receive pictures with any ultrasound that is performed.
- If you arrive late, your appointment may be rescheduled.

Thanks for assisting us in making this a great experience for you.

## Symptoms You Should Report to Your Provider:

1. Vaginal bleeding
2. Swelling of the face or fingers
3. Severe, continuous headaches
4. Visual disturbances
5. Pain in the abdomen, or menstrual-like cramps
6. Persistent vomiting
7. Chills and fever
8. Sudden escape of water from the vagina

Any of the symptoms above could indicate a serious problem requiring immediate attention. Do not wait until your next, regularlyscheduled appointment to inform your provider of any of these symptoms, please call our office immediately. If after hours, call First Nurse.

## Guidelines on Exposures During Pregnancy

- Paint products - latex-based paints are the safest
- Pesticides -Avoid
- Insect repellents are acceptable ; consider wipes or creams. Avoid aerosols and use lower concentrations of DEET.
- ZIKA: www.acog.org/zika

For information on other exposures in pregnancy you can use MotherToBaby.org or call them  at 866-626-6847.

The above guidelines are general. You should discuss concerns with your provider.

## Nutrition Information

## Fish

Avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, Big Eye tuna, marlin, orange roughy, or tilefish as they contain high amounts of a form of mercury that may harm an unborn baby's brain or nervous system.

Limit fresh water fish caught by family and friends to one serving each week.

Enjoy up to 12 ounces of other cooked fish each week. Fish contain DHA, an omega-3 fat, that is important in development of the baby's brain, nerves and retina. You can find best choices of fish on our website.

If you do not eat seafood, talk with your provider about a DHA supplement (at least 200mg/per day) that is safe to take during pregnancy.

## Listeriosis

Listeriosis is an illness caused by bacteria found in certain foods. Symptoms can include fever, chills, muscle aches and backpain. The disease can cause serious problems for the fetus, including miscarriage or stillbirth.

To prevent listeriosis, wash all fresh fruits and vegetables before using them. Avoid the following foods:

- Unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, ciders.
- Raw or undercooked meat or poultry, runny eggs.
- Prepared meats, such as hot dogs or deli meats, unless they are heated until steaming hot.

Foodsafety.gov has a complete list of foods to avoid in pregnancy and updates on food recalls.

Vitamins: Please take a prenatal vitamin with folic acid 800mcg per day and DHA 200mg per day.

Don't Forget Water! Water is an essential nutrient that is commonly overlooked.  It assists in digestion and transport of food.  Water is the main substance in cells, blood, and other vital body fluids.  It also aids in maintaining body temperature.  You should drink six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water and non-caffeine liquids every day. Please limit caffeine to 200mg/day.

Snacks: Snacks should be nutrient-rich.  Good choices include fresh fruit and vegetables, yogurt, low-fat cheese, cereal, and low-fat crackers. Remember, a healthy lifestyle and wise food choices during pregnancy can help your baby get a healthy start in life.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Is spotting normal?

A little intermittent spotting can be normal, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. A small amount of blood may appear as the placenta is attaching to the uterine wall. Another cause might be the breakdown of a small vessel on the cervix following intercourse. It is best to document any bleeding and call our office.

## What about the occasional sharp pain I have in the pelvic or groin area?

This may be due to 'round ligament' pain. These ligaments support the uterus. They will sometimes spasm or cramp, causing discomfort. Usually, modification of your activity and avoiding sudden movement will decrease the pain. This problem is very common between 12 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, if any pain becomes persistent or increases in frequency or severity, you should call your doctor.

## Why do I seem to have more headaches and what can I do to relieve them?

Headaches early in pregnancy may result from hormonal variation, nasal congestion, fatigue, eye strain, anxiety or tension. In the vast majority of cases, however, no cause can be demonstrated.

By mid-pregnancy, most of these headaches decrease in severity or disappear. Treatment is largely symptomatic. You might try the following:

-  Relaxation and rest in a darkened room
-  Cool compress to forehead
-  Tylenol
-  If your headaches persist or are severe, you should call our office.

## Is it ok to get a perm or hair color?

Yes, however, your perm may not respond the same during your pregnancy. Don't blame your stylist if you don't get as much curl with the perm. Instead, blame your hormones. We do suggest waiting until after the first trimester. Hair color may vary too.

## At what point should I notify the doctor if I have a fever?

Please call us if your oral temperature is above 100.4 degrees.

## Are there any restrictions on lifting?

We recommend limiting any lifting to less that 50 pounds. Please check with your provider as each person's fitness level is different. Also, do remember to use good body mechanics to prevent unnecessary straining of the lower back muscles; bend at your knees rather than the waist when picking something up.

## May I paint or refinish wood?

If you feel it necessary to do some painting or refinishing, be certain you do it in a well-ventilated room. Latex-based paints are the safest to use during pregnancy. Do not use oil-based paints.

## Are Prenatal Classes Offered?

There are several prenatal classes available for you and your family. Visit www.mgmc.org for classes and events.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I sometimes have a nosebleed or bleeding gums?

Nosebleeds are a common occurrence with pregnancy. They occur because of increased blood flow to the mucous membranes. This problem happens more in winter months when heating systems in homes make the air dry. Using a humidifier may help overcome this dryness. If the bleeding is frequent and heavy, please call us. The gums tend to bleed easily because of pregnancy hormones causing some swelling and tenderness. We recommend seeing your dentist during pregnancy and practicing good oral hygiene. If you suspect a dental problem, contact your dentist.

## Is an increase in vaginal discharge normal?

Yes. This can be common throughout your pregnancy. Increased blood supply and hormones cause your vagina to increase its normal secretions. The normal acidic environment also changes, which causes yeast infections to be more common. Wear cotton underwear. Call our office if your discharge smells foul or causes burning or itching.

## Can I douche?

No, you should not douche during pregnancy.

## May my partner and I continue to have intercourse during my pregnancy?

Yes, unless there is a specific problem with your pregnancy such as placenta previa, history of premature labor, etc. You may find sexual activity becomes more awkward or difficult as time goes on. Different positions for intercourse may be more comfortable. During the last month of pregnancy, you should consult your doctor regarding whether or not you should continue.

## Is it ok to use saunas or hot tubs?

No, we recommend that you do not use these during pregnancy. The high temperatures can cause damage to your developing baby.

## Can I prevent stretch marks?

No, but controlling the amount and rate of weight gain does help. Each individual's skin has the ability to stretch, but nobody knows how much. For that reason, you cannot avoid stretch marks, which are most common on the abdomen and may occur on the thighs and breasts. It may help with the itching that frequently accompanies these marks to massage the skin daily with lotion. It may be of comfort to know that these will usually fade somewhat after delivery.

## What are Braxton-Hicks contractions?

These contractions may be felt as early as week 20 of your pregnancy. They are more intense in women who have had a previous pregnancy. The uterus is flexing its muscles, getting ready for the real contractions of labor. Braxton-Hicks contractions are sometimes uncomfortable. They last anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. If you have discomfort with these contractions, try lying down and relaxing, or getting up and walking around. Most often changing your position will stop the contractions. If you have questions or concerns about any contractions you are experiencing, please call.
