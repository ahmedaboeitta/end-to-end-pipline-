## Does Your Home Sale Qualify for the Exclusion of Gain?

The tax code recognizes the importance of home ownership  by  allowing  you  to  exclude  gain  when  you  sell  your main home. To qualify for the maximum exclusion of gain ($250,000 or $500,000 if married filing  jointly),  you  must meet  the Eligibility  T est ,  explained  later.  To  qualify  for  a partial  exclusion  of  gain,  meaning  an  exclusion  of  gain less than the full amount, you must meet one of the situations listed in Does Your Home Qualify for a Partial Exclusion of Gain , later.

Before  considering  the Eligibility  T est or  whether  your home qualifies for a partial exclusion, you should consider some preliminary items.

## Transfer of your home to a spouse or an ex-spouse.

Generally,  if  you  transferred  your  home  (or  share  of  a jointly owned home) to a spouse or ex-spouse as part of a divorce settlement, you are considered to have no gain or loss. You have nothing to report from the transfer and this entire  publication  doesn't  apply  to  you.  However,  if  your spouse or ex-spouse is a nonresident alien, then you likely will  have a gain or loss from the transfer and the tests in this publication apply.

Home's date of sale. To determine if you meet the Eligibility T est or qualify for a partial exclusion, you will need to know the home's date of sale, meaning when you sold it. If you  received  Form  1099-S,  Proceeds  From  Real  Estate Transactions,  the  date  of  sale  appears  in  box  1.  If  you didn't receive Form 1099-S, the date of sale is either the date the title transferred or the date the economic burdens and benefits of ownership shifted to the buyer, whichever date is earlier. In most cases, these dates are the same.

Sale of your main home. You may take the exclusion, whether maximum or partial, only on the sale of a home that is your principal residence, meaning your main home. An  individual  has  only  one  main  home  at  a  time.  If  you own and live in just one home, then that property is your main home. If you own or live in more than one home, then you must apply a "facts and circumstances" test to determine which property is your main home. While the most important factor is where you spend the most time, other factors  are  relevant  as  well.  They  are  listed  below.  The more of  these  factors  that  are  true  of  a  home,  the  more likely that it is your main home.

- The address listed on your:
1. U.S. Postal Service address,
2. Voter Registration Card,
3. Federal and state tax returns, and
4. Driver's license or car registration.
- The home is near:
1. Where you work,
2. Where you bank,
3. The residence of one or more family members, and
4. Recreational clubs or religious organizations of which you are a member.

Finally, the exclusion can apply to many different types of  housing  facilities.  A  single-family  home,  a  condominium,  a  cooperative  apartment,  a  mobile  home,  and  a houseboat each may be a main home and therefore qualify for the exclusion.

## Eligibility Test

The Eligibility Test determines whether you are eligible for the maximum exclusion of gain ($250,000 or $500,000 if married filing jointly).

## Eligibility Step 1-Automatic Disqualification

Determine whether any of the automatic disqualifications apply. Your home sale isn't eligible for the exclusion if ANY of the following are true.

- You acquired the property through a like-kind exchange (1031 exchange), during the past 5 years. See Pub. 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets.
- You are subject to expatriate tax. For more information about expatriate tax, see chapter 4 of Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.

If any of these conditions are true, the exclusion doesn't apply. Skip to Figuring Gain or Loss , later.

## Eligibility Step 2-Ownership

Determine whether you meet the ownership requirement. If  you  owned  the  home  for  at  least  24  months  (2 years) out of the last 5 years leading up to the date of sale (date of the closing), you meet the ownership requirement. For a married couple filing jointly, only one spouse has to meet the ownership requirement.

## Eligibility Step 3-Residence

Determine whether you meet the residence requirement. If  you  owned  the  home  and  used  it  as  your  residence for at least 24 months of the previous 5 years, you meet the residence requirement. The 24 months of residence can fall  anywhere  within  the  5-year  period,  and  it doesn't  have  to  be  a  single  block  of  time.  All  that  is  required is a total of 24 months (730 days) of residence during  the  5-year  period.  Unlike  the  ownership  requirement, each  spouse  must  meet  the  residence  requirement  individually for a married couple filing jointly to get the full exclusion.

If  you were ever away from home, you need to determine  whether  that  time  counts  toward  your  residence requirement. A vacation or other short absence counts as time you lived at home (even if you rented out your home while you were gone).

If  you  become  physically  or  mentally  unable  to care  for  yourself, and  you  use  the  residence  as  your main home for at least 12 months in the 5 years preceding the sale or exchange, any time you spent living in a care facility  (such  as  a  nursing  home)  counts  toward  your 2-year residence requirement, so long as the facility has a license from a state or other political entity to care for people with your condition.

## Eligibility Step 4-Look-Back

Determine whether you meet the look-back requirement. If  you  didn't  sell  another  home  during  the  2-year period before the date of sale (or, if you did sell another home during this period, but didn't take an exclusion of the gain earned from it), you meet the look-back requirement. You may take the exclusion only once during a 2-year period.

## Eligibility Step 5-Exceptions to the Eligibility Test

There are some exceptions to the Eligibility Test. If any of the following situations apply to you, read on to see if they

may  affect  your  qualification.  If  none  of  these  situations apply, skip to Step 6.

- A separation or divorce occurred during the ownership of the home. See Separated or divorced taxpayers .
- The death of a spouse occurred during the ownership of the home. See Surviving spouses .
- The sale involved vacant land. See Vacant land next to home .
- You owned a remainder interest, meaning the right to own a home in the future, and you sold that right. See Remainder interest .
- Your previous home was destroyed or condemned. See Home destroyed or condemned-considerations for benefits .
- You were a service member during the ownership of the home. See Service, Intelligence, and Peace Corps personnel .
- You acquired or are relinquishing the home in a like-kind exchange. See Like-kind/1031 exchange .
- You used a portion of the real property, separate from the living space, for business or rental use, and you didn't use any of the separate portion for residential use for 2 years out of the 5 years leading up to the sale. See Property Used Partly for Business or Rental .
- You or your spouse (or former spouse) used the entire property as a vacation home or rental after 2008. See Business or Rental Use of Home .

Separated or divorced taxpayers. If you were separated or divorced prior to the sale of the home, you can treat the home as your residence if:

- You are a sole or joint owner, and
- Your spouse or former spouse is allowed to live in the home under a divorce or separation agreement and uses the home as his or her main home.

If  your  home  was  transferred  to  you  by  a  spouse  or ex-spouse (whether in connection with a divorce or not), you  can  count  any  time  when  your  spouse  owned  the home  as  time  when  you  owned  it.  However,  you  must meet  the  residence  requirement  on  your  own.  If  you owned your home prior to your marriage and after your divorce  or  separation,  and  your  spouse  or  former  spouse isn't allowed to live in the home under a divorce or separation  agreement,  you  can  count  any  time  that  you  owned the home, solely or jointly with your spouse, as time when you owned it. However, you must meet the residence requirement on your own.

Surviving spouses. If  you  are  a  surviving  spouse who doesn't meet the 2-year ownership and residence requirements  on  your  own,  consider  the  following  rule.  If  you haven't remarried at the time of the sale, then you may include any time when your late spouse owned and lived in the home, even if without you, to meet the ownership and residence requirements.

Also,  you  may  be  able  to  increase  your  exclusion amount  from  $250,000  to  $500,000.  You  may  take  the higher exclusion if you meet all of the following conditions.

1. You sell your home within 2 years of the death of your spouse;
2. You haven't remarried at the time of the sale;
3. Neither you nor your late spouse took the exclusion on another home sold less than 2 years before the date of the current home sale; and
4. You meet the 2-year ownership and residence requirements (including your late spouse's times of ownership and residence, if applicable).

Service, Intelligence, and Peace Corps personnel. If you or your spouse are a member of the Uniformed Services  or  the  Foreign  Service,  an  employee  of  the  intelligence community of the United States,  or  an  employee, enrolled volunteer or volunteer leader of the Peace Corps, you  may  choose  to  suspend  the  5-year  test  period  for ownership and residence when you're on qualified official extended duty. This means you may be able to meet the 2-year residence test even if, because of your service, you didn't  actually  live  in  your  home  for  at  least  the  2  years during the 5-year period ending on the date of sale. Make the election by filing your tax return for the year of the sale or  exchange  of  your  main  home,  and  exclude  the  gain from your taxable income.

Qualified extended duty. You are on qualified extended duty if:

- You are called or ordered to active duty for an indefinite period, or for a definite period of more than 90 days.
- You are serving at a duty station at least 50 miles from your main home, or you are living in government quarters under government orders.
- You are one of the following:
1. A member of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard);
2. A member of the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or the Public Health Service;
3. A Foreign Service chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or officer;
4. A member of the Senior Foreign Service or the Foreign Service personnel;
5. An employee, enrolled volunteer, or enrolled volunteer leader of the Peace Corps serving outside the United States; or
6. An employee of the intelligence community, meaning:
- a. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National

Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or the National Reconnaissance Office;

- b. Any other office within the Department of Defense for the collection of specialized national intelligence through reconnaissance programs;
- c. Any of the intelligence elements of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of the Treasury, Department of Energy, and Coast Guard;
- d. The Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the Department of State; or
- e. Any of the elements of the Department of Homeland Security concerned with the analyses of foreign intelligence information.

Period  of  suspension. The  period  of  suspension can't last more than 10 years. Together, the 10-year suspension period and the 5-year test period can be as long as,  but  no  more  than,  15  years.  You  can't  suspend  the 5-year  period  for  more  than  one  property  at  a  time.  You can  revoke  your  choice  to  suspend  the  5-year  period  at any time.

Example 1. You bought a home on May 1, 2008. You used it as your main home until August 27, 2011. On August 28, 2011, you went on qualified official extended duty with  the  Navy.  You  didn't  live  in  the  house  again  before selling it on August 1, 2024. You choose to use the entire 10-year suspension period. Therefore, the suspension period would extend back from August 1, 2024, to August 2, 2014, and the 5-year test period would extend back to August 2, 2009. During that period, you owned the house all 5 years and lived in it as your main home from August 2, 2009,  until  August  28,  2011,  a  period  of  more  than  24 months. You meet the ownership and use tests because you owned and lived in the home for at least 2 years during this test period.

Example  2. You  bought  and  moved  into  a  home  in 2015. You lived in it as your main home for 3 1 /2 years. For the next 6 years, you didn't live in it because you were on qualified  official  extended  duty  with  the  Army.  You  then sold the home at a gain in 2024. To meet the use test, you choose to suspend the 5-year test period for the 6 years you were on qualified official  extended duty. This means you  can  disregard  those  6  years.  Therefore,  your  5-year test  period  consists  of  the  5  years  before  you  went  on qualified  official  extended  duty.  You  meet  the  ownership and use tests because you owned and lived in the home for 3 1 /2 years during this test period.

Vacant land next to home. You can include the sale of vacant land adjacent to the land on which your home sits as part of a sale of your home if ALL of the following are true.

- The sale of the vacant land and the sale of your home occurred within 2 years of each other.
- You owned and used the vacant land as part of your home.
- Both sales either meet the Eligibility Test or qualify for partial tax benefits, as described earlier.

Also, if your sale of vacant land meets all these requirements, you must treat that sale and the sale of your home as a single transaction for tax purposes, meaning that you may apply the exclusion only once.

Note. However, if you move your home from the land on which it stood (meaning you relocate the actual physical  structure),  then  that  land  no  longer  counts  as  part  of your home. For example, if you move a mobile home to a new lot and sell the old lot, then you can't treat the sale of the old lot as the sale of your home.

Home destroyed or condemned-considerations for benefits. If  an  earlier  home  of  yours  was  destroyed  or condemned, you may be able to count your time there toward the ownership and residence test.

If your home was destroyed, see Pub. 547, Casualties, Disasters,  or  Thefts.  If  your  home  was  condemned,  see Pub. 544, Sales and Other Disposition of Assets.

Remainder interest. The sale of a remainder interest in your home is eligible for the exclusion only if both of the following conditions are met.

- The buyer isn't a 'related party.' A related party can be a related person or a related corporation, trust, partnership, or other entity that you control or in which you have an interest.
- You haven't previously sold an interest in the home for which you took the exclusion.

Like-kind/1031  exchange. If  you  sold  a  home  that  you acquired  in  a  like-kind  exchange,  then  the  following  test applies.

You can't claim the exclusion if:

1. Either (a) or (b) applies:
- a. You acquired your home in a like-kind exchange (also known as a section 1031 exchange), or
- b. Your basis in your home is determined by reference to a previous owner's basis, and that previous owner acquired the property in a like-kind exchange (for example, the owner acquired the home and then gave it to you); and
2. You sold the home within 5 years of the date your home was acquired in the like-kind exchange.

A main home isn't available for exchange because the exchange must be between like-kind real property held for productive  use  in  a  trade  or  business  or  for  investment. Also, real property held primarily for sale isn't eligible for deferral  of  gain  under  section  1031.  For  an  exchange  of rental property that was later converted to personal use as a main home, there is a 5-year holding period required under section 121(d)(10). A separate 2-year holding period is required for exchanges between related persons under section 1031(f). See Pub. 544.

If  you  convert your main home to a rental property (or use  a  portion  of  the  living  area  for  productive  use  in  a

trade or business as in Rev. Proc. 2005-14, examples 36), the exchange rules under section 1031 and exclusion of income rules under section 121 may both apply.

For additional information about the intersection of sections  121  and  1031,  see  Rev.  Proc.  2005-14,  2005-7 I.R.B. 528, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2005-07\_IRB#RP-2005-14 .  Please  note,  however,  that any period after 2008 during which the property isn't used as  a  principal  residence  is,  with  certain  exceptions,  considered nonqualified use of that property for which gain allocable  to  such  period  may  not  be  excluded,  in  accordance with section 121(b)(5). This includes property that is separate from the main property and not a part of the living  area  of  the  main  home  that  isn't  used  as  a  principal residence for  a  period  after  2008.  See  section  121(b)(5) (C). See also Rev. Proc. 2005-14 for examples that illustrate  how  to  allocate  basis  and  gain  realized  in  an  exchange that is also eligible  for  section  121  exclusion,  as well as details of depreciation recapture.

If  the  requirements of both sections 1031 and 121 are met, the section 121 exclusion is applied first to realized gain; section 1031 then applies, including any gain attributable  to  depreciation  deductions.  Any  cash  received  in exchange for the rental property is taken into account only to the extent the cash exceeds the section 121 excluded gain on the rental property given up in the exchange. The period before the exchange that is after the last date the property was used as a main home isn't considered nonqualified use for purposes of the proration rules of section 121.  To  figure  basis  of  the  property  received  in  the  exchange (replacement property), any gain excluded under section  121  is  added  to  your  basis  of  your  replacement property, similar to the treatment of recognized gain. You can't  convert  the  replacement  property  to  a  main  home immediately  after  the  exchange  per  section  1031(a)(1), which  requires  that  replacement  property  be  held  either for  investment,  or  for  productive  use  in  a  trade  or  business. For more information about like-kind exchanges, see Pub. 544.

## Eligibility Step 6-Final Determination of Eligibility

If  you  meet  the  ownership,  residence,  and  look-back  requirements, taking the exceptions into account, then you meet the Eligibility  Test.  Your  home  sale  qualifies  for  the maximum exclusion. Skip to Worksheet 1, later.

If  you  didn't  meet  the  Eligibility  T est,  then  your  home isn't  eligible  for  the  maximum  exclusion,  but  you  should continue  to Does Your Home Qualify for  a  Partial  Exclusion of Gain .

## Does Your Home Qualify for a Partial Exclusion of Gain?

If you don't meet the Eligibility Test, you may still qualify for a partial exclusion of gain. You can meet the requirements for  a  partial  exclusion  if  the  main  reason  for  your  home sale was a change in workplace location, a health issue, or an unforeseeable event.

## Work-Related Move

You meet the requirements for a partial exclusion if any of the  following  events  occurred  during  your  time  of  ownership and residence in the home.

- You took or were transferred to a new job in a work location at least 50 miles farther from the home than your old work location. For example, your old work location was 15 miles from the home and your new work location is 65 miles from the home.
- You had no previous work location and you began a new job at least 50 miles from the home.
- Either of the above is true of your spouse, a co-owner of the home, or anyone else for whom the home was their residence.

## Health-Related Move

You meet the requirements for a partial exclusion if any of the  following  health-related  events  occurred  during  your time of ownership and residence in the home.

- You moved to obtain, provide, or facilitate diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease, illness, or injury for yourself or a family member.
- You moved to obtain or provide medical or personal care for a family member suffering from a disease, illness, or injury. A family member includes your:
1. Parent, grandparent, stepmother, stepfather;
2. Child (including adopted child, eligible foster child, and stepchild), grandchild;
3. Brother, sister, stepsibling;
4. Mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law;
5. Uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece.
- A doctor recommended a change in residence for you because you were experiencing a health problem.
- The above is true of your spouse, a co-owner of the home, or anyone else for whom the home was their residence.

## Unforeseeable Events

You meet the standard requirements if any of the following events  occurred  during  the  time  you  owned  and  lived  in the home you sold.

- Your home was destroyed or condemned.
- Your home suffered a casualty loss because of a natural or man-made disaster or an act of terrorism. (It doesn't matter whether the loss is deductible on your tax return.)
- You, your spouse, a co-owner of the home, or anyone else for whom the home was their residence:
1. Died;

2. Became divorced or legally separated, or were issued a separate decree to pay maintenance (support) to the other spouse;
3. Gave birth to two or more children from the same pregnancy;
4. Became eligible for unemployment compensation;
5. Became unable, because of a change in employment status, to pay basic living expenses for the household (including expenses for food, clothing, housing, medication, transportation, taxes, court-ordered payments, and expenses reasonably necessary for making an income).
6. An event is determined to be an unforeseeable event in IRS published guidance.

## Other Facts and Circumstances

Even if  your  situation  doesn't  match  any  of  the  standard requirements described above, you still may qualify for an exception. You may qualify if you can demonstrate the primary reason for sale, based on facts and circumstances, is  work  related,  health  related,  or  unforeseeable.  Important factors are:

- The situation causing the sale arose during the time you owned and used your property as your residence.
- You sold your home not long after the situation arose.
- You couldn't have reasonably anticipated the situation when you bought the home.
- You began to experience significant financial difficulty maintaining the home.
- The home became significantly less suitable as a main home for you and your family for a specific reason.

## Figuring Gain or Loss

To figure the gain or loss on the sale of your main home, you must know the selling price, the amount realized, and the  adjusted  basis.  Subtract  the  adjusted  basis  from  the amount realized to get your gain or loss.

Selling price

- Selling expenses

Amount realized

- Adjusted basis

Gain or loss

A positive number indicates a gain; a negative number indicates a loss.

Certain  events  during  your  ownership,  such  as  use  of your home for business purposes or your making improvements  to  it,  can  affect  your  gain  or  loss.  They  are  explained in this section.

See Worksheet 2, later, for steps you should follow to figure your gain or loss.

## Basis Adjustments-Details and Exceptions

You should include many, but not all, costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of your home in the basis

of your home. For more information on determining basis, see Pub. 551, Basis of Assets.

## Fees and Closing Costs

Some settlement fees and closing costs you can include in your basis are:

- Abstract fees (abstract of title fees),
- Legal fees (including fees for the title search and preparing the sales contract and deed),
- Charges for installing utility services,
- Recording fees,
- Transfer or stamp taxes, and
- Survey fees,
- Owner's title insurance.

Settlement  costs  don't  include  amounts  placed  in  escrow for the future payment of items such as taxes and insurance.

Some settlement  fees  and  closing  costs  you  can't  include in your basis are:

- Fire and casualty insurance premiums,
- Charges for utilities or other services related to occupancy of the house before closing,
- Rent for occupancy of the house before closing,
- Any fee or cost that you deducted as a moving expense (allowed for certain fees and costs before 1994),
- Charges connected with getting a mortgage loan, such as:
1. Mortgage insurance premiums (including funding fees connected with loans guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs),
2. Loan assumption fees,
3. Cost of a credit report,
4. Fee for an appraisal required by a lender,
5. Points (discount points, loan origination fees), and
- Fees for refinancing a mortgage.

Construction. If you contracted to have your house built on the land you own, your basis is:

- The cost of the land, plus
- The amount it cost you to complete the house, including:
1. The cost of labor and materials,
2. Any amounts paid to a contractor,
3. Any architect's fees,
4. Building permit charges,
5. Utility meter and connection charges, and
6. Legal fees directly connected with building the house.

Your  cost  includes  your  down  payment  and  any  debt such as a first or second mortgage or notes you gave the seller or builder. It also includes certain settlement or closing costs. In addition, you must generally reduce your basis by points the seller paid you.

If you built all or part of your house yourself, its basis is the total amount it cost you to complete it. Don't include in the cost of the house:

- The value of your own labor, or
- The value of any other labor for which you didn't pay.

Costs  owed  by  the  seller  that  you  paid. You  can  include in your basis any amounts the seller owes that you agree to pay (as long as the seller doesn't reimburse you), such as:

- Any real estate taxes owed up through the day before the sale date,
- Back interest owed by the seller,
- Charges for improvements or repairs that are the seller's responsibility (for example, lead paint removal), and
- The seller's title recording or mortgage fees,
- Sales commissions (for example, payment to the seller's real estate agent).

## Improvements

Improvements add to the value of your home, prolong its useful life, or adapt it to new uses. You add the cost of additions and improvements to the basis of your property.

The  following  chart  lists  some  examples  of  improvements.

## Examples of Improvements That Increase Basis

Keep for Your Records

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Repairs  done  as  part  of  larger  project. You  can  include repair-type work if it is done as part of an extensive remodeling or restoration job. For example, replacing broken windowpanes is a repair, but replacing the same window  as  part  of  a  project  of  replacing  all  the  windows  in your home counts as an improvement.

## Examples  of  improvements  you  CAN'T  include  in your basis. You can't include:

- Any costs of repairs or maintenance that are necessary to keep your home in good condition but don't add to its value or prolong its life. Examples include painting (interior or exterior), fixing leaks, filling holes or cracks, or replacing broken hardware.
- Any costs of any improvements that are no longer part of your home (for example, wall-to-wall carpeting that you installed but later replaced).
- Any costs of any improvements with a life expectancy, when installed, of less than 1 year.

Exception. The  entire  job  is  considered  an  improvement if items that would otherwise be considered repairs are done as part of an extensive remodeling or restoration of  your  home.  For  example,  if  you  have  a  casualty  and your  home  is  damaged,  increase  your  basis  by  the amount you spend on repairs that restore the property to its pre-casualty condition. However, you must adjust your basis by any amount of insurance reimbursement you receive or expect to receive for casualty losses. See Worksheet 2, line 5.

Energy  credits  and  subsidies. If  you  included  in  your basis the cost of any energy-related improvements (such as a solar energy system), and you received any tax credits  or  subsidies related to those improvements, you must subtract  those  credits  or  subsidies  from  your  total  basis. Examples include:

- 1977-1987: Credit for home energy improvements,
- 1992-present: Direct or indirect subsidy from a public utility for installations or modifications aimed at lowering a home's electricity or natural gas usage or better managing its energy demand,
- 2006-present: Credit for home energy efficiency improvements,
- 2006-present: Credit for qualified solar electric property expenditures, qualified solar water heating property expenditures, and qualified battery storage property expenditures,
- 2006-2007, 2009-present: Credit for energy improvements to non-business properties (windows, skylights, exterior doors, heat pump, waterheater, biomass stoves, and boilers), and
- 2023-2032: Credit for home energy audits, involving an inspection and written report for a main home located in the United States (within the meaning of section 121), as conducted and prepared by a certified home energy auditor.

## Home Acquired Through a Trade

Traded for another home. When you trade your home for a new one, you are treated as having sold your home and purchased a new one. Your sale price is the trade-in value  you  received  for  your  home  plus  any  mortgage  or other debt that the person taking your home as a trade-in assumed (took over) from you as part of the deal.

Traded for other property. If you paid for your home by trading  other  property  for  it,  the  starting  basis  of  your home is usually the fair market value of the property you traded.

## Home Foreclosed, Repossessed, or Abandoned

If  your  home  was  foreclosed  on,  repossessed,  or  abandoned, you may have ordinary income, gain, or loss. See Pub.  4681,  Canceled  Debts,  Foreclosures,  Repossessions, and Abandonments.

If you used part of your home for business or rental purposes, see Foreclosures and Repossessions in chapter 1 of Pub. 544, for examples of how to figure gain or loss.

## Home Destroyed or Condemned

You  have  a  disposition  when  your  home  is  destroyed  or condemned and you receive other property  or  money  in payment,  such  as  insurance  or  a  condemnation  award. This is treated as a sale and you may be able to exclude all or part of any gain that you have. If your home was destroyed, see Pub. 547. If your home was condemned, see Pub. 544.

## Home Received in Divorce

Home  acquired  after  July  18,  1984. If  your  former spouse  was  the  sole  owner,  your  starting  basis  is  the same as your former spouse's adjusted basis just before you  received  the  home.  If  you  co-owned  the  home  with your  spouse,  add  the  adjusted  basis  of  your  spouse's half-share in the home to the adjusted basis of your own half-share  to  get  your  starting  basis.  (In  most  cases,  the adjusted  basis  of  the  two  half-shares  will  be  the  same.) The rules  apply  whether  or  not  you  received  anything  in exchange for the home.

Home acquired on or before July 18, 1984. Your starting basis will usually be the home's fair market value at the time you acquired it from your spouse or ex-spouse.

For more information, see Pub. 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals. If you or your spouse or ex-spouse lived in a community property state, see Pub. 555, Community Property.

## Home Received as a Gift

If  you  received  your  home as a gift,  you  should keep records of the date you received it. Record the adjusted basis of the donor at the time of the gift and the fair market value of the home at the time of the gift. Also ask if the donor paid any gift tax. As a general rule, you will use the donor's adjusted basis at the time of the gift as your basis. However,  see  Table  1  below  to  determine  if  any  exceptions to this rule listed in the 'IF' column apply.

Table 1. Exceptions to Using a Donor's Adjusted Basis for a Home Received as a Gift

| IF...                                                                                                       | AND...                                                                    | THEN...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| at the time of the gift, the donor's adjusted basis in the home was more than the home's fair market value, | your usage of the donor's adjusted basis as your basis results in a loss, | you must use the fair market value of the home at the time of the gift as your basis (if using the fair market value results in a gain for you, then you don't need to recognize that gain).                                                        |
| at the time of the gift, the donor's adjusted basis in the home was less than the home's fair market value, | the donor paid gift tax on the gift of the home,                          | you figure your basis by starting with the donor's adjusted basis at the time of the gift and adding the federal gift tax paid due to the increase in value of the home (see Regulations section 1.1015-5 for further details on this calculation). |

## Home Inherited

Home acquired from a decedent who died before or after  2010. If  you  inherited  your  home  from  a  decedent who died before or after 2010, your basis is the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death (or  the  later  alternate  valuation  date  chosen  by  the  personal representative of the estate). If a federal estate tax return  (Form  706)  was  filed  or  required  to  be  filed,  the value of the property listed on the estate tax return is your basis. If Form 706 didn't have to be filed, your basis in the home  is  the  same  as  its  appraised  value  at  the  date  of death,  for  purposes  of  state  inheritance  or  transmission taxes. See section 1014 for details.

Surviving spouse. If  you are a surviving spouse and you owned your home jointly, your basis in the home will change. The new basis for the interest your spouse owned will be its fair market value on the date of death (or alternate valuation date). The basis in your interest will remain the same. Your new basis in the home is the total of these two amounts.

If  you and your spouse owned the home either as tenants by the entirety or as joint tenants with right of survivorship,  you  will  each  be  considered  to  have  owned one-half of the home.

Example. Your  jointly  owned  home  (owned  as  joint tenants with right of survivorship) had an adjusted basis of $50,000 on the date of your spouse's death, and the fair market value on that date was $100,000. Your new basis in the home is $75,000 ($25,000 for one-half of the adjusted  basis  plus  $50,000  for  one-half  of  the  fair  market value).

Community  property. In  community  property  states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico,  T exas,  Washington,  and  Wisconsin),  each  spouse  is usually considered to own half of the community property. When either spouse dies, the total fair market value of the

community property becomes the basis of the entire property, including the part belonging to the surviving spouse. For  this  rule  to  apply,  at  least  half  the  value  of  the  community  property  interest  must  be  includible  in  the  decedent's gross estate, whether or not the estate must file a return.

For  more  information  about  community  property,  see Pub. 555, Community Property.

If you are selling a home in which you acquired an interest  from  a  decedent  who  died  in  2010,  see Pub.  4895,  Tax  Treatment  of  Property  Acquired From a Decedent Dying in 2010, available at IRS.gov/pub/ CAUTION !

## Property Used Partly for Business or Rental

Calculation. If  you  use  property  partly  as  a  home  and partly for business or to produce rental income, the treatment of any gain on the sale depends partly on whether the business or rental part of the property is part of your home or separate from it. If you fail to meet the ownership and  use  tests,  or  if  you  used  a  separate  portion  of  your home for business or rental purposes during your ownership, this may affect your gain or loss calculations. If a portion of the property was used for residential purposes and another portion of the property, separate from the dwelling unit, was used for nonresidential purposes, then only the gain allocable to the residential portion is excludable under Section 121. The Section 121 exclusion is reduced to the extent of any depreciation adjustments in connection with the rental or business use of your residence. For details and an example, see Recapturing Depreciation , later. Treatment of any gain also depends on the use during the 5 years leading up to the sale. To figure the portion of the gain  allocated  to  the  period  of  nonresidential  use,  see Business  or  rental  usage  calculations ,  later.  See  also Worksheet 2.

Space within the living area. If the part of your property used  for  business  or  to  produce  rental  income  is  within your home, such as a room used as a home office for a business, you do not need to allocate gain on the sale of the  property  between  the  business  part  of  the  property and the part used as a home. In addition, you do not need to  report  the  sale  of  the  business  or  rental  part  on  Form 4797. This is true whether or not you were entitled to claim any depreciation. However, you can't exclude the part of any gain equal to any depreciation allowed or allowable after May 6, 1997, which must be recaptured and reported as ordinary income under section 1250(b)(3). Other examples of space within the living area include a rented spare bedroom and attic space used as a home office.

Example  of  nonresidential  use  within  a  dwelling unit. Logan,  an  attorney,  buys  a  house  in  2013.  The house is a single dwelling unit but Logan uses a portion of the  house exclusively as a law office on a regular basis. Logan claimed depreciation deductions of $2,000 during the period that the house is owned. Logan sells the house in  2016, realizing a gain of $13,000. Logan has no other section  1231  or  capital  gains  or  losses  for  2016.  Logan must recognize $2,000 of the gain as unrecaptured section 1250 gain. Logan completes Form 4797 to report the amount of ordinary income recapture. Logan may exclude the  remaining  $11,000  of  the  gain  from  the  sale  of  the house because Logan is not required to allocate gain to the business use within the dwelling unit. See Regulations section 1.121-1(e). See also Determine any depreciation amounts you may need to recapture for  guidance  on  reporting depreciation previously deducted.

Space  separate  from  the  living  area. You  generally can't exclude gain on the separate portion of your property used  for  business  or  to  produce  rental  income.  Regulations section 1.121-1(e) provides that the use of a separate portion of your home for business or rental purposes doesn't  qualify  for  exclusion  under  section  121,  and  this may affect your gain or loss calculations. See Regulations section 1.121-1(e). Examples are:

- A working farm on which your house was located,
- A duplex in which you lived in one unit and rented the other, or
- A store building with an upstairs apartment in which you lived.

You  can't  exclude  gain  on  the  separate  part  of  your property  used  for  business  or  to  produce  rental  income unless you owned and lived in that part of your property for at least 2 years during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale. If you don't meet the use test for the separate business or rental part of the property, an allocation of the gain on the sale is required. For this purpose, you must allocate the basis of the property and the amount realized between the residential and nonresidential portions of  the  property  using  the  same method of allocation that you used to determine depreciation adjustments. See the Example for  allocating residential and nonresidential portions  of  the  property.  Report  the  sale  of  the  business  or rental part on Form 4797. For more information about using any part of your home for business or as a rental property, see Pub. 587, Business Use of Your Home, and Pub. 527, Residential Rental Property.

Space formerly used as business or rental. Note that space formerly used as business or rental will qualify for exclusion under section 121 if the space was converted to the taxpayer's principal residence for a total of 2 years or more, as long as the use as the principal residence was within the 5 years leading up to the sale. See Regulations section 1.121-1(a). However, depreciation deductions claimed during the previous business use must be reported on line 5a of Worksheet 2 and recognized as unrecaptured section 1250 gain. No separate Business worksheet is  needed because there are no current business expenses. See Regulations section 1.121-1(d). See also the Instructions for Form 4797, and the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).

Business  or  rental  usage  calculations. If  you  use property  partly  as  a  home  and  partly  for  business  or  to

produce rental income, and the business or rental portion isn't within the home's living area, you need to make separate gain/loss calculations for the business and residence portions of your property. Make three copies of all pages of Worksheet 2. Label one copy 'Total,' one copy 'Home,' and one copy 'Business or Rental.'

Determine your 'business or rental percentage,' meaning the percentage of your property that you used for business or rental. Section 121 requires you to recognize depreciation  claimed  on  a  home  after  May  6,  1997.  If  you were entitled to take depreciation deductions because you used a portion of your home for business purposes or as rental  property,  you  can't  exclude  the  part  of  your  gain equal  to  any  depreciation  allowed  or  allowable  as  a  deduction for periods after May 6, 1997.

Complete  your  'Total'  worksheet  using  the  figures  for your property as a whole. Include the total amount you received, all of your basis adjustments, etc. Include the cost of all improvements, whether you made them to the business space or the residential space.

If you used part of your home for business or rental after May 6, 1997, you may need to pay back ('recapture') some or all of the depreciation you were entitled to take on your property. 'Recapturing' depreciation means you must include it as ordinary income on your tax return. If you took depreciation  on  your  home  on  past  tax  returns,  use  the same business or rental percentage that you used in determining how much depreciation to take. If you didn't take depreciation on your home on past tax returns, compare the size of your business or rental space to the size of the whole property and express this as a percentage. For example, if  you  have  a  building  with  three  equal-sized  stories, and you live in the top two stories and use the ground floor for a store, then you are using  1 /3 of the property and your business percentage is 33.3%.

For each number on your 'Total' worksheet, figure the business-related  portion  of  that  number  and  enter  it  on your 'Business or Rental' worksheet. You may use different methods to determine the business portion of different numbers.  Here  are  the  three  possible  methods  and  the circumstances under which each method applies.

- Dollar-amount method. Where a figure consists of specific dollar amounts that relate to either the residence portion or the business portion of the property, the figure must be broken down by these dollar amounts. For example, if the figure for improvements to the property was $100,000, and all of that applied to the residence portion, then the business portion of the improvements would be zero.
- '100% rule' for depreciation. The first item under line 5a in Worksheet 2 is a business depreciation item. Any figure for this item is 100% a business figure.
- Percentage method. Where a figure applies to the property as a whole (such as the sale price), the business or rental portion is the figure multiplied by the business portion percentage you calculated earlier. Use the percentage method for all items that don't require the dollar-amount or depreciation methods.

The total you get on line 7 on your 'Business' copy of Worksheet 2 is the gain or loss related to the business or rental portion of the property you sold.

Now figure  the  totals  on  your  'Home'  worksheet.  The total you get on line 7 on the 'Home' copy of Worksheet 2 is the gain or loss related to the home portion of the property you sold.

Next, complete your 'Home' worksheet. For each number, take the number from your 'Total' worksheet, subtract the  number  from  your  'Business  or  Rental'  worksheet, and enter the result in your 'Home' worksheet (for example,  subtract  the  number  on  line  1f  of  the  "Business  or Rental" worksheet from the number on line 1f of your "Total" worksheet), and enter the result on your "Home" worksheet.

Review  the  results  of  your  'Home'  and  'Business' worksheets to determine your next step. When you have completed  each  worksheet,  you  will  know  whether  you have a gain or loss on each part of your property. It is possible to have a gain on both parts, a loss on both parts, or a gain on one part and a loss on the other. For more information about using any part of your home for business or as a rental property, see Pub. 587, Business Use of Your Home, and Pub. 527, Residential Rental Property.

Example. The following  example demonstrates separate calculations for business and residential uses.

Because the stable and the 28 acres used in the business  are  separate  from  the  dwelling  unit,  the  allocation rules apply. Stacey must allocate the basis and amount realized between the portion of the property used as a principal  residence  and  the  portion  used  for  non-residential purposes based on their respective FMVs. Stacey creates three copies of Worksheet 2 and titles them 'Business or Rental,'  'Home,'  and  'Total'  to  allocate  basis  and  the amount realized for the different uses of the property.

Stacey owns property that consists of a house, a stable and  35  acres.  Stacey  uses  the  stable  and  28  acres  for non-residential purposes for more than 3 years during the 5-year period preceding the sale. Stacey uses the entire house and the remaining 7 acres as a principal residence for at least 2 years during the 5-year period preceding the sale. For periods after May 6, 1997, Stacey claims depreciation deductions of $9,000 for the non-residential use of the stable. Stacey sells the entire property in 2014, realizing a gain of $24,000. Stacey has no other section 1231 or capital gains or losses for 2014.

Stacey determines that $14,000 of the gain is allocable to the non-residential-use portion of the property by completing  the  copy  of  Worksheet  2  entitled  'Business  or Rental.' Stacey determines that $10,000 of the gain is allocable to the portion of the property used as a residence by completing the copy of Worksheet 2 entitled 'Home.' Stacey  must  recognize  the  $14,000  of  gain  allocable  to  the non-residential-use  portion  of  the  property  ($9,000  of which  is  unrecaptured  section  1250  gain,  and  $5,000  of which is adjusted net capital gain). Stacey reports gain associated with the non-residential-use portion of the property  on  Form  4797.  Stacey  may  have  to  complete  Form 8949  and  Schedule  D  (Form  1040).  See Sale  of  Home Used for Business , in the Instructions for Form 4797. See

also  the  Instructions  for  Form  8949,  and  the  Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).

Stacey transfers the gain from the 'Home' worksheet to Worksheet 3, reviews the maximum amount available for exclusion as figured on Worksheet 1, and determines that the  $10,000 gain from the residence portion is less than the  maximum amount available for exclusion from Worksheet 1. The $10,000 gain on the property may be excluded.

Complete Worksheet 2. Then see Table 2 to determine your next steps. Worksheet 2 is used to figure the adjusted basis of your home and your gain or (loss). You will figure your taxable gain (if any), on Worksheet 3, later.

## Worksheet 2. How To Figure Your Gain or Loss

## Business or Rental Use of Home

Nonqualified use of entire property after 2008. If you fail to meet the requirements to qualify for the $250,000 or $500,000 exclusion, you may still qualify for a reduced exclusion. If you fail to meet the ownership and use tests, or if,  after  2008,  you  (your  spouse  or  former  spouse)  didn't use your home as a principal residence, this type of usage may affect your gain or loss calculations.

Gain from the sale or exchange of your main home isn't excludable from income if it is allocable to periods of nonqualified  use.  Nonqualified  use  means  any  period  after 2008  where  neither  you  nor  your  spouse  (or  former spouse) used the property as your main home, with certain exceptions.

Exceptions. A  period  of  nonqualified  use  does  not  include:

1. Any portion of the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange after the last date you or your spouse (or former spouse) used the property as your main home;
2. Any period (not to exceed 10 years) during which you (or your spouse) are serving on qualified official extended duty:
- a. As a member of the uniformed services;
- b. As a member of the Foreign Service of the United States; or
- c. As an employee of the intelligence community; and
3. Any other period of temporary absence (not to exceed an aggregate period of 2 years) due to change of employment, health conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances as may be specified by the IRS. See Eligibility Step 5 Exceptions to the Eligibility Test , and Does Your Home Sale Qualify for the Exclusion of Gain? , earlier.

Gain from depreciation for  periods  after  May  6,  1997, isn't  taken  into  account  to  determine  gain  from  nonqualified use. Such gain is not accounted for in determining the amount of gain allocated to nonqualified use. To figure the portion of the gain allocated to the period of nonqualified use, see Worksheet 3.

Example. Finley buys a property on January 1, 2019, for $400,000, and uses the entire property as rental property for 2 years, claiming $20,000 of depreciation deductions  and  reducing  the  property's  basis  to  $380,000.  On January 1, 2021, Finley converts the property to a principal residence. Finley moves out on January 1, 2023, and sells  the  property  for  $700,000  on  January  1,  2024.  The total gain on the sale is $320,000 ($700,000 - ($400,000 -  $20,000)).  Finley  completes  Worksheet  2  and  enters $20,000 on line 5a so that line 7 reports $320,000.

In Section B of Worksheet 3, Finley allocates 40% (2/5, or  2  years  out  of  5)  of  the  remaining  $300,000  gain,  or $120,000,  to  nonqualified  use  ($300,000  -  $120,000  = $180,000). The $120,000 nonqualified use gain is ineligible  for  the  section  121  exclusion  and  is  reported  as long-term  capital  gain  on  Schedule  D  (Form  1040).  The $180,000 of the remaining gain is excluded from gross income, as reported in Section C of Worksheet 3. The balance  of  the  $250,000  exclusion  can't  be  used.  The $20,000 attributable to the depreciation deduction is included  in  ordinary  income  under  section  1250.  See Determine any depreciation amounts you may need to recapture to figure the amount to report as ordinary income on

Finley  transfers  the  $320,000  net  gain  from  line  7  of Worksheet 2 to Worksheet 3. Finley completes Section A of Worksheet 3 and takes the amount from line 7 of Worksheet  2,  $320,000,  and  subtracts  $20,000  for  depreciation. Finley enters $300,000 ($320,000 - $20,000 depreciation)  in  Step  3  (Section  A).  Moving  to  Section  B  of Worksheet 3, Finley has $300,000 in net gain that is potentially  excluded,  except  for  the  period  of  nonqualified use.  The  rental  period  occurred  for  2  out  of  5  years  that Finley owned the property and met the use test by using the home as a principal residence for 2 years (January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2023). Note that the rental period occurred before Finley moved back into the home to fulfill the required 2-year personal use requirement.

Form 4797. For information on reporting $120,000 of nonqualified use gain (long-term capital gain), see the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).

Example. Taylor  buys  a  residence  on  January  1, 2019, for $400,000, and immediately begins using it as a principal residence. Taylor moves out on January 1, 2022, and immediately begins to rent the home. On December 1, 2023, Taylor sells the property for $600,000. Based on the facts presented, note that the rental periods after Taylor's  last  qualified use is not considered nonqualified use because nonqualified use during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale doesn't include the time between when  Taylor  last  used  the  property  as  Taylor's  principal residence and when Taylor sold the property. See section 121(b)(5)(C)(ii).  Because  Taylor  met  the  ownership  and use tests, Taylor can exclude gain up to $250,000. Taylor had  deducted  $27,000  for  depreciation  for  the  period  of rental  to  a  3rd  party.  T aylor  can't  exclude  the  part  of  the gain equal to the depreciation claimed after May 6, 1997, for renting the house ($27,000).

After  subtracting  depreciation  from  net  gain  in  Worksheet 2, line 7, if Taylor's net gain had exceeded the maximum exclusion amount for a single filer, any capital gain above the threshold ($250,000) would have been reported on  Schedule  D  (Form  1040)  as  long-term  capital  gain. However, Taylor must report the $27,000 depreciation as ordinary income on Form 4797.

After  subtracting  depreciation  from  net  gain,  Taylor's net  gain  reported  in  Worksheet  3,  Section  A,  Step  3  is $200,000,  calculated  as  follows:  Taylor  had  completed Worksheet 2 and reported $600,000 on line 1, $400,000 on line 4a, and $27,000 on line 5a. Taylor computed figures  on  Worksheet  2  and  reported  $227,000  on  line  7 ($600,000 - ($400,000 - $27,000)). Taylor transferred the result from line 7 to Worksheet 3. Taylor completed Section A to enter net gain and subtract the $27,000 of depreciation deductions taken. Taylor entered $200,000 in Step 3 of Section A. Taylor skipped Section B because there is no nonqualified use based on the exception under section 121(b)(5)(C)(ii).  Taylor  completed  Section  C  for  the  column  'you  completed  Section  A  but  skipped  Section  B' and  took  the  figure  from  Section  A,  Step  3  and  entered $200,000.  The  entire  $200,000  gain  is  excludable  from gross income because periods after the last qualified use don't constitute nonqualified use.

## How Much Is Taxable?

Review  of  the  Eligibility  Test. Generally,  your  home sale qualifies for the maximum exclusion, if all of the following conditions are true.

- You didn't acquire the property through a like-kind exchange in the past 5 years.
- You aren't subject to the expatriate tax.
- You owned the home for at least 2 of the last 5 years and lived in the home for at least 2 (1 if you become disabled) of the last 5 years leading up to the date of the sale.*
- For the 2 years before the date of the current sale, you didn't sell another home on which you claimed the exclusion.
- You didn't use a portion of the home, outside of the living area, for business or rental purposes.
- You didn't use the entire property for business or rental purposes, or as a second home, after 2008.
- The sale doesn't involve the transfer of vacant land or a remainder interest.**

*If  this  condition isn't met, your home sale may qualify for a partial exclusion. The sale must involve one of the following events experienced by you, your spouse, a co-owner,  or  anyone  else  for  whom  the  home  was  their residence: a work-related move, a health-related move, a death,  a  divorce,  a  pregnancy  with  multiple  children,  a change in employment status, a change in unemployment compensation eligibility, or other unusual event.

For  a  step-by-step  guide  to  determining  whether  your home sale qualifies for the maximum exclusion, see Does Your Home Sale Qualify for the Exclusion of Gain? above.

**The transfer of vacant land or of a remainder interest may qualify for the maximum exclusion, but special rules apply in those situations.

If you qualify for an exclusion on your home sale, up to $250,000  ($500,000  if  married  and  filing  jointly)  of  your gain will be tax free. If your gain is more than that amount, or if you qualify only for a partial exclusion, then some of your gain may be taxable. This section contains step-by-step instructions for figuring out how much of your gain is taxable. See Worksheet 3, later, for assistance in determining your taxable gain.

If  you  determined in Does Your Home Sale Qualify for the Exclusion of Gain , earlier, that your home sale doesn't qualify  for  any  exclusion  (either  full  or  partial),  then  your entire gain is taxable. If you don't have a gain, you owe no tax on the sale. In either case, you don't need to complete Worksheet  3  and  you  can  skip  to Reporting  Your  Home Sale , later.

## Recapturing Depreciation

If  you  were  entitled  to  take  depreciation  deductions  because you used your home for business purposes or as rental  property,  you  cannot  exclude  the  part  of  your  gain equal  to  any  depreciation  allowed  or  allowable  as  a  deduction  for  periods  after  May  6,  1997.  If  you  used  all  of your  home for  business  or  rental  after  May  6,  1997,  you may need to pay back ('recapture') some or all of the depreciation you were entitled to take on your property. 'Recapturing' depreciation means you must include it as ordinary income on your tax return.

See Determine  any  depreciation  amounts  you  may need to recapture , later, for more detail.

Example. Cartier  owned  and  used  a  house  as  a  main home from 2016 through 2019. On January 1, 2020, Cartier moved to another state. Cartier rented the home from that date until April 30, 2022, when Cartier sold it. During the  5-year  period  ending  on  the  date  of  sale  (May  1, 2017-April  30,  2022),  Cartier  owned  and  lived  in  the house for more than 2 years. Because the period of nonqualified use doesn't include any part of the 5-year period after the last date Cartier lived in the home, there is no period of nonqualified use. Because Cartier met the owner- ship and  use  tests, Cartier can  exclude  gain  up  to $250,000. However, Cartier can't exclude the part of the gain  equal  to  the  depreciation  Cartier  claimed,  or  could have claimed, for renting the house.

Worksheet 3 is used to help you figure taxable gain on the sale or exchange of your home (if any), and how to report it.

If you completed 'Business or Rental' and 'Home' versions of your gain/loss worksheet as described in Property Used Partly for Business or Rental , earlier, complete this worksheet only for the 'Home' version. However, the section 121 exclusion is reduced to the extent of any depreciation adjustments in connection with the business use of your residence. Enter any depreciation reported on line 5a of the Business or Rental Worksheet in Section A of Worksheet 3. Worksheet 2 allocated a separate portion of the property used for Business or Rental, if any, to figure the amount of gain potentially excluded under section 121. Worksheet 3 helps you figure how much of the gain calculated in Worksheet 2 will be excluded under section 121 based on whether you, your spouse, or a former spouse used the entire property as your principal residence or for another purpose like for rental use or as a second home, or vacation home.

Complete this section only if the following apply: a) During the time you owned the property there were periods of nonqualified use when neither you nor your spouse (or your former spouse) used the entire property as your main home; b) the periods of nonqualified use occurred after 2008; c) the periods of nonqualified use occurred before the last day the entire property was used as your or your spouse's (or your former spouse) main home prior to the date of sale. Do not include any period of nonqualified use that occurred after the last day that you or your spouse (or former spouse) used the entire property as your main home during the 5-year period prior to the date of sale.* Otherwise, skip to Section C.

*Note . If the period of non-use was 1) for an aggregate of 2 years or less and due to a change in employment, a health condition, or other "unforeseen circumstance" described in Does Your Home Qualify for a Partial Exclusion of Gain , earlier; or 2) for 10 years or less and due to a "stop the clock" exception for certain military, intelligence, and Peace Corps personnel described in Service, Intelligence, and Peace Corps Personnel , earlier, then you may skip Section B.

## Reporting Your Home Sale

This section tells you how to report taxable gain, take deductions  relating  to  your  home  sale,  and  report  income other than the gain that you may have received from your home sale.

This section also covers special circumstances that apply to some home sellers.

<!-- image -->

What records to keep. Any time you buy real estate,  you  should  keep  records  to  document  the property's adjusted basis. In general, keep these records until 3 years after the due date for your tax return for the year in which you sold your home.

## Reporting Gain or Loss on Your Home Sale

Determine whether you need to report the gain from your home. You need to report the gain if ANY of the following is true.

- You have taxable gain on your home sale (or on the residential portion of your property if you made separate calculations for home and business) and don't qualify to exclude all of the gain.
- You received a Form 1099-S. If so, you must report the sale on Form 8949 even if you have no taxable gain to report. See Instructions for Form 8949 and Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040) for more details.
- You wish to report your gain as a taxable gain even though some or all of it is eligible for exclusion. You may wish to do this if, for example, you plan to sell another main home within the next 2 years and are likely to receive a larger gain from the sale of that property. If you later choose to report, rather than exclude, your taxable gain, you can undo that choice by filing an amended return within 3 years of the due date of your return for the year of the sale, excluding extensions.

If  NONE  of  the  three  bullets  above  is  true,  you  don't need to report your home sale on your tax return. If you didn't make separate home and business calculations on your  property,  skip  to Reporting  Deductions  Related  to Your Home Sale , later.

If ANY of the three bullets above is true, skip to Determine whether your home sale is an installment sale , later.

If  you  made  separate  gain/loss  calculations  for business  and  residence  portions  of  your  property, you may have to use Form 4797 to report the sale of the business or rental part. See Property Used Partly for Business or Rental , earlier.

Determine any depreciation amounts you may need to recapture. The exclusion of gain doesn't apply to any gain from depreciation adjustments attributable to periods after May 6, 1997. Such gain is not accounted for in determining the amount of gain allocated to business or rental use.  You  must  adjust  basis  for  depreciation  deducted  in earlier  years.  If  you  didn't  deduct  any  depreciation,  decrease your basis by the amount you could have deducted.  For  information  on  depreciation  deductions  associated with business or rental use of a principal residence,

see Pub. 946. For depreciation deducted during periods of rental or business use, the adjustment to basis will affect net gain or loss. Upon the sale of real property, depreciation is taxed as ordinary income and net gain in excess of the maximum excludable (for your filing status) is taxed at the capital gains rate. See the Instructions for Form 4797 and for Schedule D (Form 1040) to figure the total amount of depreciation deductions for any period when the property was used for business or rental.

Determine whether your home sale is an installment sale. If  you  finance  the  buyer's  purchase  of  your  home (you hold a note, mortgage, or other financial agreement), you probably have an installment sale. You may be able to report  any  non-excludable  gain  on  an  installment  basis. Use  Form  6252,  Installment  Sale  Income,  to  report  the sale.

For more information, see Pub. 537, Installment Sales.

Report any interest you receive from the buyer. If the buyer is making payments to you over time (as when you provide  seller  financing),  then  you  must  generally  report part of each payment as interest on your tax return. Report the interest portion of the payment as ordinary income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 2b, or Schedule NEC (Form 1040-NR) if a nonresident alien. If the buyer is using the property as a first or second home, also report the interest on  Schedule  B  (Form  1040),  Interest  and  Ordinary  Dividends, and provide the buyer's name, address, and social security number. If you don't show the buyer's name, address, and SSN you may have to pay a $50 penalty.

If  you're  a  nonresident  or  resident  alien  who doesn't have and isn't eligible to get a social security number, you may be issued an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). If you don't have an ITIN, apply for one by filing Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer  Identification  Number.  If  needed,  a  nonresident  or resident alien buyer can apply for an ITIN as well.

Complete Form 8949, Sales  and  Other  Dispositions of  Capital  Assets. Use  Form  8949  to  report  gain  from the sale or disposition of the personal-use portion of your home if you can't exclude the gain. If you received Form 1099-S, report the transaction on Form 8949. See the Instructions for Form 8949.

<!-- image -->

If you have gain that can't be excluded, you must generally report it on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions  of  Capital  Assets,  and  Schedule  D

(Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses. Report the sale on  Part  I  or  Part  II  of  Form  8949  as  a  short-term  or long-term transaction, depending on how long you owned the home. In addition, you may be able to temporarily defer capital gains invested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF). You may also be able to permanently exclude capital gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in a QOF if  the  investment  is  held  for  at  least  10  years.  For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8949.

Complete Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses. Using  the  information  on  Form  8949,  report  on Schedule D (Form 1040) the gain or loss on your home as a  capital  gain  or  loss.  Follow  the  instructions  for  Schedule D when completing the form.

If you have any taxable gain from the sale of your home, you may have to increase your withholding or make estimated tax payments. See Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.

## Reporting Deductions Related to Your Home Sale

If  you  aren't  itemizing  deductions  on  your  return  for  the year in which you sold your home, skip to Reporting Other Income Related to Your Home Sale , later.

There  is  no  tax  deduction  for  transfer  taxes,  stamp taxes,  or  other  taxes,  fees,  and  charges  you  paid  when you sold your home. However, if you paid these amounts as the seller, you can treat these taxes and fees as selling expenses. If you pay these amounts as the buyer, include them in your cost basis of the property.

Determine the amount of real estate tax deductions associated  with  your  home  sale. Depending  on  your circumstances, you may need to figure your real estate tax deductions differently. See the discussion that follows for more information.

If you didn't receive a Form 1099-S, use the following  method  to  compute  your  real  estate  tax  deduction, which may be different from the amount of real estate tax you actually paid.

- Divide the number of days you owned the property during the year of sale, not counting the date of sale, by 365 (or 366 for a leap year).
- Multiply that figure by the amount of real estate tax due on the home during the 12-month billing cycle that contains the date of sale. The result is the amount of real estate tax you can deduct as an itemized deduction.

Example. The  real estate tax on Jackie and  Pat White's  home  was  $620  for  the  year.  Their  real  property tax year was the calendar year, with payment due August 3, 2023. They sold the home on May 6, 2023. Jackie and Pat are considered to have paid a proportionate share of the real estate taxes on the home even though they didn't actually pay them to the taxing authority.

Jackie and Pat owned their home during the 2023 real property  tax  year  for  125  days  (January  1  to  May  5,  the day before the sale). They figure their deduction for taxes as follows.

|   1. | Total real estate taxes for the real property tax year . .                                                           | $620   |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|    2 | Number of days in the real property tax year that you owned the property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 125    |
|    3 | Divide line 2 by 365 (366 if leap year) . . . . . . . . . . .                                                        | 0.342  |
|    4 | Multiply line 1 by line 3. This is your deduction. Enter it on line 5b of Schedule A (Form 1040) . . . . . . . . . . | $212   |

Since the buyers paid all of the taxes, Jackie and Pat also include the $212 in the home's selling price. The buyers add the $212 to their basis in the home. The buyers can

deduct $408 ($620 - $212) as an itemized deduction, the taxes for the part of the year they owned the home.

If you received a Form 1099-S, start with the amount of real estate tax you actually paid in the year of sale. Subtract  the  buyer's  share  of  real  estate  tax,  as  shown  in box  6.  The  result  is  the  amount  you  can  use  in  figuring your itemized deductions.

If  you  didn't  already  deduct  all  your  mortgage points on an earlier tax return, you may be able to deduct them on your tax return for the year of sale. See Pub. 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.

Report on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions,  any  itemized  real  estate  deduction. Follow  the Instructions for Schedule A when completing the form.

## Reporting Other Income Related to Your Home Sale

Report as ordinary income on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or  1040-NR  any  amounts  received  from  selling  personal property. If you sold furniture, drapes, lawn equipment, a washer/dryer, or other property that wasn't a permanent part of your home, report the amount you received for  the  items  as  ordinary  income.  Report  this  amount  on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, or Schedule NEC (Form 1040-NR) if a nonresident alien. The selling price of your home doesn't include amounts you received for personal property sold with your home.

Report as ordinary income on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or  1040-NR  any  amounts  received  for  sales  of  expired options to purchase your property. If  you granted someone an option to buy your home and it expired in the  year  of  sale,  report  the  amount  you  received  for  the option as ordinary income. Report this amount on Schedule  1  (Form  1040),  line  8z,  or  Schedule  NEC  (Form 1040-NR) if a nonresident alien.

Report as ordinary income on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or  1040-NR  applicable  canceled  or  forgiven  mortgage debt. If you went through a mortgage workout, foreclosure, or other process in which a lender forgave or canceled  mortgage  debt  on  your  home,  then  you  must generally report the amount of forgiven or canceled debt as income on your tax return. However, if you had a written agreement for the forgiveness of the debt in place before January  1,  2026,  then  you  might  be  able  to  exclude  the forgiven amount from your income. For more information, see Pub. 4681, Canceled Debts, Foreclosures, Repossessions, and Abandonments.

## Paying Back Credits and Subsidies

If you received any homebuyer credits or federal mortgage subsidies, you may have to pay back ('recapture') some or all of the amount by increasing your tax payment.

Determine any amounts you may have claimed as a first-time  homebuyer  tax  credit. If  you  bought  your home in 2008, you must pay back the credit unless you qualify for an exception.

See  Form  5405,  Repayment  of  the  First-Time  Homebuyer Credit, to find out how much to pay back, or if you qualify  for  any  exceptions.  If  you  do  have  to  repay  the credit, file Form 5405 with your tax return.

Determine  any  amounts  you  may  have  received  in federal mortgage subsidies in the 9 years leading up to the date of sale. If  you  financed  your  home under a federally subsidized program (loans from tax-exempt qualified  mortgage  bonds  or  loans  with  mortgage  credit certificates),  you  may have to recapture all or part of the benefit  you  received  from  that  program  upon  the  sale  or other  transfer  of  ownership  of  your  home.  You  recapture the  benefit  by  increasing  your  federal  income  tax  for  the year of  the  sale.  Y ou  may  have  to  pay  this  recapture  tax even if you can exclude your gain from income under the rules  discussed  earlier;  that  exclusion  doesn't  affect  the recapture tax.

If  you did receive any federal mortgage subsidies, you must file Form 8828 with your tax return whether you sold your home at a loss or a gain. If you had a loss, you won't have to pay back any subsidy.

See Form 8828, Recapture of Federal Mortgage Subsidy, to find out how much to repay, or whether you qualify for any exceptions.

Go to IRS.gov/DirectFile

for more information, program updates, and frequently asked questions.

- Free File. This program lets you prepare and file your federal individual income tax return for free using software or Free File Fillable Forms. However, state tax preparation may not be available through Free File. Go to IRS.gov/FreeFile to see if you qualify for free online federal tax preparation, e-filing, and direct deposit or payment options.
- VITA. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program offers free tax help to people with low-to-moderate incomes, persons with disabilities, and limited-English-speaking taxpayers who need help preparing their own tax returns. Go to IRS.gov/ VITA , download the free IRS2Go app, or call 800-906-9887 for information on free tax return preparation.
- TCE. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program offers free tax help for all taxpayers, particularly those who are 60 years of age and older. TCE volunteers specialize in answering questions about pensions and retirement-related issues unique to seniors. Go to IRS.gov/TCE or download the free IRS2Go app for information on free tax return preparation.
- MilTax. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces and quali-
- fied veterans may use MilTax, a free tax service offered by the Department of Defense through Military OneSource. For more information, go to MilitaryOneSource ( MilitaryOneSource.mil/MilTax ). Also, the IRS offers Free Fillable Forms, which can be completed online and then e-filed regardless of income.

Using online tools to help prepare your return. Go to IRS.gov/Tools for the following.

- The Earned Income Tax Credit Assistant ( IRS.gov/ EITCAssistant ) determines if you're eligible for the earned income credit (EIC).

Need someone to prepare your tax return? There are various  types  of  tax  return  preparers,  including  enrolled agents, certified public accountants (CPAs), accountants, and many others who don't have professional credentials. If  you  choose  to  have  someone  prepare  your  tax  return, choose that preparer wisely. A paid tax preparer is:

- Primarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return,
- Required to sign the return, and
- Required to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).

<!-- image -->

Although the tax preparer always signs the return, you're  ultimately  responsible  for  providing  all  the information required for the preparer to accurately prepare your return and for the accuracy of every item reported on the return. Anyone paid to prepare tax returns for  others  should  have  a  thorough  understanding  of  tax matters. For more information on how to choose a tax preparer, go to Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer on IRS.gov.

Employers can register to use Business Services Online. The Social Security Administration (SSA) offers online service at SSA.gov/employer for fast, free, and secure W-2 filing options to CPAs, accountants, enrolled agents, and  individuals  who  process  Form  W-2,  Wage  and  Tax Statement;  and  Form  W-2c,  Corrected  Wage  and  Tax Statement.

Business  tax  account. If  you  are  a  sole  proprietor,  a partnership, or an S corporation, you can view your tax information on record with the IRS and do more with a business tax account. Go to IRS.gov/Business-Tax-Account for more information.

IRS social media. Go to IRS.gov/SocialMedia to see the various social media tools the IRS uses to share the latest information on tax changes, scam alerts, initiatives, products, and services. At the IRS, privacy and security are our highest priority. We use these tools to share public information with  you. Don't post  your  social  security  number (SSN)  or  other  confidential  information  on  social  media

sites.  Always  protect  your  identity  when  using  any  social networking site.

Using direct deposit. The safest and easiest way to receive  a  tax  refund  is  to  e-file  and  choose  direct  deposit, which securely and electronically transfers your refund directly  into  your  financial  account.  Direct  deposit  also avoids the possibility that your check could be lost, stolen, destroyed,  or  returned  undeliverable  to  the  IRS.  Eight  in 10 taxpayers use direct deposit to receive their refunds. If you don't have a bank account, go to IRS.gov/ DirectDeposit for more information on where to find a bank or credit union that can open an account online.

## Reporting  and  resolving  your  tax-related  identity theft issues.

- Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit.
- The IRS doesn't initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs),

passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.

- Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft , the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you're a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.
- Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns. When you have an IP PIN, it prevents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN .

## Ways to check on the status of your refund.

- Go to IRS.gov/Refunds .
- Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status.
- Call the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954.

<!-- image -->

The IRS can't issue refunds before mid-February for  returns  that  claimed  the  EIC  or  the  additional child tax credit (ACTC). This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits. CAUTION !

Making a  tax  payment. Payments  of  U.S.  tax  must  be remitted to the IRS in U.S. dollars. Digital assets are not accepted. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for information on how to make a payment using any of the following options.

You may  not  immediately  receive  written  communications  in the  requested  language.  The  IRS's  commitment  to  LEP taxpayers is part of a multi-year timeline that began providing  translations  in  2023.  You  will  continue  to  receive communications, including notices and letters, in English until they are translated to your preferred language.

Contacting your local TAC. Keep in mind, many questions can be answered on IRS.gov without visiting a TAC. Go to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for the topics people ask about most. If you still need help, TACs provide tax help when a tax  issue  can't  be  handled  online  or  by  phone.  All  TACs now provide service by appointment, so you'll know in advance that you can get the service you need without long wait times. Before you visit, go to IRS.gov/TACLocator to find  the  nearest TAC and to check hours, available services,  and  appointment  options.
