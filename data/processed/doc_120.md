## 2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose(s)

## WEGOVY ®  Injection

- If one dose of WEGOVY ®  injection is missed and the next scheduled dose is:
- More than 2 days away, administer WEGOVY ®  injection as soon as possible.
- Less than 2 days away do not administer the WEGOVY ® injection dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
- If 2 or more consecutive doses of WEGOVY ®  injection are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY ®  injection and follow the dosage escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with reinitiation of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

## WEGOVY ®  Tablets

If a dose of WEGOVY ®  tablets is missed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose the following day.

## 2.5 Switching Between WEGOVY ®  Injection and WEGOVY ®  Tablets

Switching from WEGOVY ®  Injection to WEGOVY ®  Tablets

- Patients taking WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injection for cardiovascular risk reduction or weight reduction in adults may switch to WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets.
- One week after discontinuing WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injection, initiate 25 mg of WEGOVY ®  tablets orally once daily.

Switching from WEGOVY ®  Tablets to WEGOVY ®  Injection

- Patients may switch from WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets to
- WEGOVY ®  injection.
- The day after discontinuing WEGOVY ®  tablets 25 mg once daily, initiate WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly. For patients who do not tolerate WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets, consider switching to WEGOVY ®  1.7 mg injection.
- If additional weight reduction is needed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets, consider switching to WEGOVY ®  1.7 mg injection and follow the recommended dosage escalation for WEGOVY ®  injection.

## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

WEGOVY ®  is contraindicated in the following conditions:

- A personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- A prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in WEGOVY ®  injection or WEGOVY ® tablet. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with WEGOVY ®  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

## 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent  increase  in  the  incidence  of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether WEGOVY ®  causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans, as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

WEGOVY ®  is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of WEGOVY ® and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine  monitoring  of  serum  calcitonin  or  using  thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in

patients treated with WEGOVY ® . Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

## 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including WEGOVY ®  [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. After initiation of WEGOVY ® , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, which may include persistent or severe abdominal pain (sometimes radiating to the back), and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue WEGOVY ® and initiate appropriate management.

## 5.3 Acute Gallbladder Disease

Treatment  with  WEGOVY ®   is  associated  with  an  increased occurrence of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The incidence of  cholelithiasis  and  cholecystitis  was  higher  in  WEGOVY ® injection-treated pediatric patients aged 12 years and older than in  WEGOVY ®  injection-treated adults. In randomized clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, cholelithiasis was reported by 1.6% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 0.7% of placebo injection-treated patients, and by 2.5% of WEGOVY ®  tablet-treated patients and 1% of placebo tablet-treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by 0.6% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated adult patients and 0.2% of placebo- treated patients. In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for weight reduction, cholelithiasis was reported by 3.8% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 0% placebo-treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by 0.8% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated pediatric patients and 0% placebotreated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Substantial  or  rapid  weight  loss  can  increase  the  risk  of cholelithiasis; however, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease was greater in WEGOVY ® -treated patients than in placebo-treated patients, even after accounting for the degree of weight loss. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.

## 5.4 Hypoglycemia

WEGOVY ®  lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia. In a trial of WEGOVY ®  injection in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2  for weight reduction (Study 3), hypoglycemia (defined as a plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL) was reported in more patients treated with WEGOVY ®  versus placebo [see Adverse Reaction (6.1)]. One episode of severe hypoglycemia (requiring the assistance of another person) was reported in one WEGOVY ® treated patient versus no placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

In  glycemic  control  clinical  trials,  the  risk  of  hypoglycemia was increased when semaglutide injection or tablet was used concomitantly  with  insulin  or  an  insulin  secretagogue  (e.g., sulfonylurea). Patients with diabetes mellitus taking WEGOVY ® in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. The use of WEGOVY ®  in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or in combination with insulin has not been evaluated.

Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In patients with diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY ®  and during WEGOVY ®  treatment. When initiating WEGOVY, consider reducing  the  dose  of  concomitantly  administered  insulin  or insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

## 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in  some  cases  requiring  hemodialysis,  in  patients  treated with  semaglutide [see  Adverse  Reactions  (6)].  The  majority of  the  reported  events  occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal adverse reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to WEGOVY ®  that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of WEGOVY ® .

## 5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of WEGOVY ®  has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical trials for adults for weight reduction, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among  patients  receiving  WEGOVY ®   than  placebo.  Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported in 4.1% and 0.9%  of  WEGOVY ® -injection  and  placebo-treated  patients, respectively, and in 2% of WEGOVY ®  tablet-treated and 0% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have also been reported postmarketing with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

WEGOVY ®   is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  severe gastroparesis.

## 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported with WEGOVY ® . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of WEGOVY ® , treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. WEGOVY ® is contraindicated in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in WEGOVY ® [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with WEGOVY ® .

## 5.8 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 2-year trial with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg once-weekly injection in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, diabetic retinopathy complications (which was a 4-component adjudicated  endpoint)  occurred  in  patients  treated  with semaglutide injection (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at  baseline (semaglutide injection 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 for weight reduction (Study 3), diabetic retinopathy was reported by 4% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 2.7% placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

In a glycemic control trial evaluating a dose comparable to the 9 mg dose and the 25 mg semaglutide tablet dose in patients with type 2 diabetes, a similar proportion of patients in each dose group reported diabetic retinopathy related adverse reactions during the trial; 1.3% and 1.9% of patients in the 9 mg and 25 mg semaglutide group, respectively, reported moderate-severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy events, and 0% and 0.4% reported proliferative retinopathy events, respectively.

Rapid  improvement  in  glucose  control  has  been  associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of  long-term  glycemic  control  with  semaglutide  on  diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

## 5.9 Heart Rate Increase

Treatment with WEGOVY ®  was associated with increases in resting heart rate. Mean increases in resting heart rate of 1 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed in WEGOVY ®  injection-treated adult patients compared to placebo in clinical trials for weight reduction. More adult patients treated with WEGOVY ®  injection compared with placebo had maximum changes from baseline at any visit of 10 to 19 bpm (41% versus 34%, respectively) and 20 bpm or more (26% versus 16%, respectively). In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with normal baseline heart rate, more patients treated with WEGOVY ®  injection compared to placebo had maximum changes in heart rate of 20 bpm or more (54% versus 39%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Findings were similar in a trial with the WEGOVY ®  tablets.

Monitor heart rate at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers of palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while at rest during WEGOVY ®  treatment. If patients experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate, discontinue WEGOVY ® .

## 5.10  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other weight management products. Monitor patients treated with WEGOVY ®  for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Discontinue WEGOVY ®  in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Avoid WEGOVY ®  in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation.

## 5.11  Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

WEGOVY ®  delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking WEGOVY ® , including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing WEGOVY ®  could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking WEGOVY ® .

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Adults with Obesity or Overweight for Weight Reduction

WEGOVY® 2.4 mg Subcutaneous Weekly Dosage

WEGOVY ®  was evaluated for safety in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that included 2,116 adult patients with obesity or overweight treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY ®  for up to 68 weeks and a 7-week off-drug follow-up period [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 48 years, 71% female, 72% White, 14% Asian, 9% Black or African American, and 5% reported as other or unknown; and 85% were not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 13% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and 2% reported as unknown. The baseline characteristics were 42% with hypertension, 19% with type 2 diabetes, 43% with dyslipidemia, 28% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m 2 , and 4% with CV disease.

In  these  clinical  trials,  6.8%  of  patients  treated  with  2.4  mg WEGOVY ®  and 3.2% of patients treated with placebo permanently discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.8% versus 0.2%), vomiting (1.2% versus 0%), and diarrhea (0.7% versus 0.1%) for WEGOVY ®  and placebo, respectively.

Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials in adults and greater than or equal to 2% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3 .

T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus d Includes chronic gastritis, gastritis, gastritis erosive, and reflux gastritis e Includes paresthesia, hyperesthesia, burning sensation, allodynia, dysesthesia, skin burning sensation, pain of skin, and sensitive skin

In a CV outcomes trial, 8,803 patients were exposed to WEGOVY ® injection for a median of 37.3 months and 8,801 patients were exposed to placebo for a median of 38.6 months [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Safety data collection was limited to serious adverse  events  (including  death),  adverse  events  leading  to discontinuation, and adverse events of special interest. Sixteen percent (16%) of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 8% of placebo-treated patients, respectively, discontinued study drug due to an adverse event. Additional information from this trial is included in subsequent sections below when relevant.

## WEGOVY ®  Tablet 25 mg Oral Daily Dosage

WEGOVY ®  tablet was evaluated for safety in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial that included 204 adult patients with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity, treated with WEGOVY ®  tablet for up to 64 weeks and a 7-week off drug follow-up period (Study 7) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 48 years, 75.6% were female, 92.7% were White, 0.5% were Asian, 6.3% were Black or African American, and 8.3% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 106.4 kg and mean BMI was 37.5 kg/m 2 . The baseline characteristics were 44% with hypertension, 31% with dyslipidemia, 27% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m 2 , and 1.5% with coronary artery disease.

In the clinical trial, 6.9% of patients treated with WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets and 5.9% patients treated with placebo permanently discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions. The most common event type leading to discontinuation was gastrointestinal adverse reactions reported in 3.4% with WEGOVY ®  tablets and 2% with placebo.

In the clinical trial with WEGOVY ®  tablets, the types and frequency of  common adverse reactions were similar to those listed in Table 3 .

## Adverse Reactions in a Clinical Trial of Pediatric Patients Aged 12 Years and Older with Obesity Treated with WEGOVY ® Injection for Weight Reduction

WEGOVY ®  injection was evaluated in a 68-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial in 201 pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 15.4 years; 38% of patients were male; 79% were White, 8% were Black or African American, 2% were Asian, and 11% were of other or unknown race; and 11% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean baseline body weight was 107.5 kg, and mean BMI was 37 kg/m 2 .

Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 3% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated pediatric patients and more frequently than in the placebo group from a study in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.

## Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Adults with MASH Treated with WEGOVY ®  Injection

The safety of WEGOVY ®  injection was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 9) that included 1,195 adult patients with MASH, including 800 patients who were exposed to WEGOVY ®  for a median of 95.3 weeks and 395 patients who were exposed to placebo for a median of 83.1 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

The most commonly reported adverse reactions were consistent with the other approved WEGOVY ®  indications (see Table 3 ). There is limited information in patients with MASH and a BMI &lt;25 kg/m 2 . Additional information from the MASH trial is included in subsequent sections when notable. Unless indicated, the incidence of the adverse reactions in MASH patients was similar to other approved indications.

## Other Adverse Reactions in Adults and/or Pediatric Patients Treated with WEGOVY ®  Injection or WEGOVY ®  Tablets

## Acute Gallbladder Disease

In  WEGOVY ®   clinical  trials  in  adults  for  weight  reduction, cholelithiasis  was  reported  by  1.6%  of  WEGOVY ® injectiontreated patients and 0.7% of placebo-treated patients and by 2.5% of WEGOVY ®  tablet-treated patients and 1% of placebo tablet-treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by 0.6% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated adult patients and 0.2% of placebotreated patients. In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for weight reduction [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], cholelithiasis  was  reported  by  3.8%  of  WEGOVY ® injectiontreated patients and 0% placebo-treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by 0.8% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated pediatric patients and 0% placebo-treated patients.

## Hypoglycemia

## Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2  for weight reduction, clinically significant hypoglycemia (defined as a plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL) was reported in 6.2% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients versus  2.5%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  A  higher  rate  of clinically significant hypoglycemic episodes was reported with WEGOVY ®  injection (semaglutide 2.4 mg) versus semaglutide 1 mg injection (10.7 vs. 7.2 episodes per 100 patient years of exposure, respectively); the rate in the placebo-treated group was 3.2 episodes per 100 patient years of exposure. In addition, one episode of severe hypoglycemia requiring intravenous glucose was reported in a WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patient versus none in placebo-treated patients. The risk of hypoglycemia was increased when WEGOVY ®  was used with a sulfonylurea.

In a glycemic control trial evaluating a dose comparable to the 9 mg dose and the 25 mg semaglutide tablet dose in patients with type 2 diabetes not on insulin, clinically significant hypoglycemia was reported in similar proportions of subjects in both treatment groups.

## Patients without Type 2 Diabetes

Episodes of hypoglycemia have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists in adult patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus. In WEGOVY ®  clinical trials in adult patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus for weight reduction, there was no systematic capturing or reporting of hypoglycemia.

In a CV outcomes trial in adult patients without type 2 diabetes, 3 episodes of serious hypoglycemia were reported in WEGOVY ® injection-treated patients versus 1 episode in placebo. Patients with a history of bariatric surgery (a risk factor for hypoglycemia) had more events of serious hypoglycemia while taking WEGOVY ® injection (2.3%, 2/87) than placebo (0%, 0/97).

## Retinal Disorders in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 for weight reduction, retinal disorders were reported by 6.9% of patients treated with WEGOVY ® injection (semaglutide 2.4 mg), 6.2% of patients treated with semaglutide 1 mg, and 4.2% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of events were reported as diabetic retinopathy (4%, 2.7%, and 2.7%, respectively) and non-proliferative retinopathy (0.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).

In  a  glycemic  control  trial  evaluating  the  9  mg  and  25  mg semaglutide tablet  doses  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes,  a similar proportion of patients in each dose group reported diabetic retinopathy related adverse reactions during the trial; 1.3% and 1.9% of patients in the 9 mg and 25 mg semaglutide group, respectively, reported moderate-severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy  events,  and  0%  and  0.4%  reported  proliferative retinopathy events, respectively.

In a 2-year trial with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg once-weekly injection  in  adult  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and  high cardiovascular risk, diabetic retinopathy complications (which was a 4-component adjudicated endpoint) occurred in patients treated with semaglutide injection (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at  baseline (semaglutide injection 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

## Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, 73% of WEGOVY ® injection-treated patients and 47% of patients receiving placebo reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including severe reactions that were reported more frequently among patients receiving  WEGOVY ®   injection  (4.1%)  than  placebo  (0.9%). The most frequently reported reactions were nausea (44% vs. 16%), vomiting (25% vs. 6%), and diarrhea (30% vs. 16%). Other  reactions  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  among WEGOVY ®  injection-treated adult patients included dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, eructation, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, hemorrhoids, and hiccups. These reactions were most frequently reported during dosage escalation.

Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported in 2% of WEGOVY ®  tablet-treated and 0% of placebo-treated patients, respectively.

In the pediatric clinical trial for weight reduction, 62% of WEGOVY ® injection-treated patients and 42% of placebo-treated patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions. The most frequently reported reactions were nausea (42% vs. 18%), vomiting (36% vs. 10%), and diarrhea (22% vs. 19%). Other gastrointestinal-related reactions that occurred at a higher incidence than placebo among WEGOVY ®  injection-treated pediatric patients included abdominal pain, constipation, eructation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, and flatulence.

Permanent  discontinuation  of  treatment  as  a  result  of  a gastrointestinal adverse reaction occurred in 4.3% of WEGOVY ® injection-treated adult patients versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In a pediatric clinical trial for weight reduction, 2.3% of  patients  treated  with  WEGOVY ® injection  versus  1.5%  of patients who received placebo discontinued treatment as a result of gastrointestinal adverse reactions.

## Other Adverse Reactions in Adults and/or Pediatric Patients Treated with WEGOVY ®  Injection

The below adverse reactions are applicable for both WEGOVY ® injection  and  WEGOVY ®   tablets  and  include  descriptions  of WEGOVY ®  injection clinical trial data, where relevant. The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY ®  tablets have not been established in pediatric patients or patients with MASH.

## Acute Pancreatitis

In WEGOVY ®  clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication in 4 WEGOVY ® -treated patients (0.2 cases per 100 patient years) and 1 in placebo-treated patients (less than 0.1 cases per 100 patient years). One additional case of acute pancreatitis was confirmed in a patient treated with WEGOVY ®  in another clinical trial.

## Acute Kidney Injury

Acute kidney injury occurred in clinical trials for weight reduction in 7 adult patients (0.4 cases per 100 patient years) receiving WEGOVY ®  versus 4 patients (0.2 cases per 100 patient years of exposure) receiving placebo. Some of these adverse reactions occurred in association with gastrointestinal adverse reactions or dehydration. In addition, 2 patients treated with WEGOVY ®  had acute kidney injury with dehydration in other clinical trials. The risk of renal adverse reactions with WEGOVY ®  was increased in adult patients with a history of renal impairment (trials included 65 patients with a history of moderate or severe renal impairment at baseline), and occurred more frequently during dose titration.

## Increase in Heart Rate

Mean increases in resting heart rate of 1 to 4 beats per minute (bpm)  were  observed  with  routine  clinical  monitoring  in WEGOVY ® -treated adult patients compared to placebo in clinical trials for weight reduction. In weight reduction trials in which adult patients were randomized prior to dose-escalation, more patients treated with WEGOVY, compared with placebo, had maximum changes from baseline at any visit of 10 to 19 bpm (41% versus 34%, respectively)  and  20  bpm  or  more  (26%  versus  16%, respectively). In a clinical trial for weight reduction in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with normal baseline heart rate, more patients treated with WEGOVY ®  compared to placebo had maximum changes in heart rate of 20 bpm or more (54% versus 39%).

## Hypotension and Syncope

Adverse reactions related to hypotension (hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and decreased blood pressure) were reported in 1.3% of WEGOVY ® -treated adult patients versus 0.4% of placebotreated patients and syncope was reported in 0.8% of WEGOVY ® treated  patients  versus  0.2%  of  placebo-treated  patients  in clinical trials for weight reduction. Some reactions were related to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and volume loss associated with WEGOVY ® . Hypotension and orthostatic hypotension were more frequently seen in patients on concomitant antihypertensive therapy. In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for weight reduction, hypotension was reported in 2.3% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients versus 0% in placebo-treated patients.

## Appendicitis

Appendicitis (including perforated appendicitis) occurred in 10 (0.5%) WEGOVY ® -treated adult patients and 2 (0.2%) patients receiving placebo in clinical trials for weight reduction.

## Injection Site Reactions

In clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, 1.4% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients and 1% of patients receiving placebo experienced injection site reactions (including injection site pruritus, erythema, inflammation, induration, and irritation).

## Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported with WEGOVY ® .

In a pediatric clinical trial for weight reduction, rash was reported in 3% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients, and urticaria was reported in 3% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In  adult  clinical  trials  for  weight  reduction,  allergic  reactions occurred in 16% (8/50) of WEGOVY ® -treated patients with antisemaglutide antibodies and in 7% (114/1659) of WEGOVY ® treated patients who did not develop anti-semaglutide antibodies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

## Fractures

In the CV outcomes trial in adults, more fractures of the hip and pelvis were reported on WEGOVY ®  than on placebo in female patients: 1% (24/2,448) vs. 0.2% (5/2,424), and in patients ages 75 years and older: 2.4% (17/703) vs. 0.6% (4/663), respectively. In a clinical trial in adults with MASH, fractures occurred in 4.4% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients (2.6 cases per 100 patient years) compared to 3.3% of placebo-treated patients (2 cases per 100 patient years). Fractures were reported in both males and females with a median age of 61 years (range, 44 to 75).

## Urolithiasis

In a CV outcomes trial, 1.2% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo reported urolithiasis, including serious reactions that  were  reported  more  frequently  among patients receiving WEGOVY ®  (0.6%) than placebo (0.4%).

## Dysgeusia

In clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, 1.7% of WEGOVY ® -treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients reported dysgeusia.

Other Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients Treated with

## WEGOVY ®  Tablets for Weight Reduction

## Dysesthesia

In a clinical trial with WEGOVY ®  tablets, 4.9% of WEGOVY ® treated  patients  and  no  placebo-treated  patients  reported dysesthesia adverse reactions, with preferred terms including sensitive skin, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, allodynia, and skin burning sensation.

## Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults and/or Pediatric Patients Treated with WEGOVY ®  Injection

The  below  laboratory  abnormalities  are  applicable  for  both WEGOVY ®   injection  and  WEGOVY ®   tablets  and  include descriptions of WEGOVY ®  injection clinical trial data, where relevant. The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY ®  tablets have not been established in pediatric patients or patients with MASH.

## Amylase and Lipase

Adult and pediatric patients treated with WEGOVY ®  had a mean increase from baseline in amylase of 15% to 16% and lipase of 39% in clinical trials for weight reduction. These changes were not observed in the placebo group.

In a clinical trial in adults with MASH, increases in lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4.7% (35/750) of WEGOVY ® -treated patients compared with 1.3% (5/374) of placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with WEGOVY ®  is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis.

## Liver Tests

In a pediatric clinical trial for weight reduction, increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN were observed in 4 (3%) WEGOVY ® -treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. In some patients, increases in ALT and AST were associated with other confounding factors (such as gallstones). In the CV outcomes trial in adults, increases in total bilirubin greater than or equal to 3 times the ULN were observed in 0.3% (30/8,585) of WEGOVY ® -treated patients versus 0.2% (14/8,579) of placebo-treated patients.

## 6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of semaglutide, the active ingredient of WEGOVY ® . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: acute pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis,  sometimes  resulting  in  death;  ileus,  intestinal obstruction, severe constipation including fecal impaction Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria Pulmonary:  Pulmonary  aspiration  has  occurred  in  patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute kidney injury

## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

## 7.1 Concomitant Use with Insulin or an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea)

WEGOVY ®  lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia. The  risk  of  hypoglycemia  is  increased  when  WEGOVY ®   is used concomitantly with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas). The addition of WEGOVY ®  in patients treated with insulin has not been evaluated.

When  initiating  WEGOVY,  consider  reducing  the  dose  of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

## 7.2 Oral Medications

WEGOVY ®   causes  a  delay  of  gastric  emptying  and  thereby has  the  potential  to  impact  the  absorption  of  concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials with semaglutide 1 mg once weekly injection, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In a drug interaction study with the semaglutide tablet, levothyroxine exposure was increased 33% (90% CI: 1.25-1.42). Monitor the effects of oral medications concomitantly administered with WEGOVY ® . Consider increased clinical or laboratory monitoring for medications that have a narrow therapeutic index or that require clinical monitoring.

## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

## 8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to semaglutide during pregnancy. Pregnant women exposed to WEGOVY ®  and healthcare providers are encouraged to contact Novo Nordisk at 1-877-390-2760 or www.wegovypregnancyregistry.com.

## Risk Summary

Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be potential risks to the fetus from exposure to semaglutide during pregnancy. Available pharmacovigilance data and data from clinical trials with WEGOVY ®  use in pregnant patients are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

Weight loss offers no benefit to a pregnant patient and may cause fetal harm. When a pregnancy is recognized, advise the pregnant patient of the risk to a fetus, and discontinue WEGOVY ®  (see Clinical Considerations).

There may be risks to the mother and fetus related to underlying MASH with advanced liver fibrosis (see Clinical Considerations). Whether semaglutide treatment during pregnancy reduces these risks is unknown. WEGOVY ®  for the treatment of MASH should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

In pregnant rats administered semaglutide during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth occurred at maternal exposures below the maximum recommended  human  dose  (MRHD)  based  on  AUC.  In rabbits  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  administered  semaglutide during organogenesis, early pregnancy losses and structural abnormalities were observed at below the MRHD (rabbit) and greater than or equal to 2-fold the MRHD (monkey). These findings coincided with a marked maternal body weight loss in both animal species (see Data).

The  background  risk  of  major  birth  defects  and  miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

## Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Appropriate  weight  gain  based  on  pre-pregnancy  weight  is currently recommended for all pregnant patients, including those who already have overweight or obesity, because of the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy.

There may be risks to the mother and fetus related to MASH with advanced liver fibrosis, such as increased risks of gestational diabetes,  hypertensive  complications,  preterm  birth,  and postpartum hemorrhage. The effect of semaglutide on these risks is unknown.

## Data

## Animal Data

In a combined fertility and embryofetal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.04-, 0.1-, and 0.4-fold the MRHD) were administered to males for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and to females for 2 weeks prior to mating, and throughout organogenesis to Gestation Day 17. In parental animals, pharmacologically mediated reductions in body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. In the offspring, reduced growth and fetuses with visceral (heart blood vessels) and skeletal (cranial bones, vertebra, ribs) abnormalities were observed at the human exposure.

In  an  embryofetal  development  study  in  pregnant  rabbits, subcutaneous doses of 0.001, 0.0025, or 0.0075 mg/kg/day

(0.01-, 0.1-, and 0.9-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis from Gestation Day 6 to 19. Pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at greater than or equal to 0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.4-, 2-, and 6-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout  organogenesis,  from  Gestation  Day  16  to  50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to 2 times human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.2-, 1-, and 3-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to 1-time human exposure).

Salcaprozate  sodium  (SNAC),  an  absorption  enhancer  in WEGOVY ®  tablets, crosses the placenta and reaches fetal tissues in rats. In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, SNAC was administered orally at 1,000 mg/ kg/day (exposure levels were not measured) on Gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20. An increase in gestation length, an increase in the number of stillbirths and a decrease in pup viability were observed.

## 8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

## WEGOVY® Oral Tablets

Data from a clinical lactation study with semaglutide oral tablet formulation  reported  semaglutide  concentrations  below  the lower  limit  of  quantification  in  human  milk.  However,  SNAC and/or  its  metabolites  are  present  in  human  milk.  Since  the activity of enzymes involved in SNAC clearance may be lower in infants compared to adults, higher SNAC plasma levels may occur in neonates and infants. Because of the unknown potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant due to the possible accumulation of SNAC, and because there are alternative formulations of semaglutide that do not contain SNAC that can be used during lactation, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with WEGOVY ®  tablets.

## WEGOVY® Subcutaneous Injection

There are no data on the presence of subcutaneously administered semaglutide or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. WEGOVY ® subcutaneous injection does not contain the SNAC metabolites.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for WEGOVY ® and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from WEGOVY ®  or from the underlying maternal condition.

## 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Because of the potential for fetal harm, discontinue WEGOVY ®  in patients at least 2 months before they plan to become pregnant to account for the long half-life of semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

## 8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY ®  injection in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity have been established. Use of WEGOVY ®  injection for this indication is supported by a 68-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 201 pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with a BMI corresponding to ≥95th percentile for age and sex [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] and from trials in adult patients with obesity [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Use of the 1.7 mg once weekly maintenance dosage of WEGOVY ®  injection in pediatric patients is  also  supported by additional exposure-efficacy and safety analyses in pooled adult and pediatric patients.

Adverse reactions with WEGOVY ® -injection treatment in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older were generally similar to those reported in adults. Pediatric patients aged 12 years and older treated with WEGOVY ®  injection had greater incidences of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hypotension, rash, and urticaria compared to adults treated with WEGOVY ®  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Although there was an increased frequency of hypoglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight treated with WEGOVY ®  injection, there are insufficient data to determine if the risk of hypoglycemia is higher in WEGOVY ® -treated pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes with obesity. Inform pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY ®  injection and during treatment. When initiating

WEGOVY ®  injection in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, consider reducing the dosage of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY ®  injection have not been established in pediatric patients:

- to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events. Clinical trials for this indication are highly impracticable because of the low prevalence of the condition in pediatric patients.
- to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in those less than 12 years of age.
- for the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH.

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY ®  tablets have not been established in pediatric patients.

## 8.5 Geriatric Use

In the WEGOVY ®  injection clinical trials for weight reduction and long-term maintenance, 233 (9%) WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients were aged 65 to less than 75 years and 23 (1%) WEGOVY ® injection-treated patients were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In a WEGOVY ® tablets clinical trial for weight reduction and long-term maintenance, 16 (8%) WEGOVY ®  tabletstreated patients were aged 65 to less than 75 years and 5 (2%) WEGOVY ®  tablet-treated patients were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

In a CV outcomes trial, 2,656 (30%) WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients were aged 65 to 75 years and 703 (8%) WEGOVY ®  injection -treated patients were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. No overall difference in the effectiveness was observed between patients aged 65 years and older and younger adult patients. In the CV outcomes trial, patients aged 75 years and older reported more hip and pelvis fractures in the WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients than placebotreated patients. Patients aged 75 years and older (WEGOVY ®  injection-treated and placebo-treated) reported more serious adverse reactions overall compared to younger adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the clinical trial in patients with MASH, of the 534 patients randomized to WEGOVY ®  injection, 138 (26%) were aged 65 years and older and 13 (2%) were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of WEGOVY ®  injection have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients with MASH.

## 8.6 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

WEGOVY ®  tablets have not been studied for weight reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Administration of WEGOVY ®  injection resulted in less weight reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight compared to those without type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

In  patients  without  type  2  diabetes,  the  average  semaglutide  blood  concentrations following administration of WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets once daily or WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injection once weekly were similar. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the average semaglutide blood concentrations following administration of WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablets once daily were lower than the average semaglutide blood concentrations following use of WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injection once weekly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The lower semaglutide blood concentrations after administration of WEGOVY ®  tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes may be associated with reductions in absolute bioavailability.

Given the differences in average semaglutide blood concentrations after administration of WEGOVY ® tablets and WEGOVY ®  injection, and the higher variability in semaglutide blood concentrations after administration of WEGOVY ®  tablets in all patient populations, some patients with type 2 diabetes taking WEGOVY ®  tablets may experience subtherapeutic semaglutide blood concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes with an inadequate response to WEGOVY ®  tablets, consider alternative therapies, including switching to WEGOVY ®  injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

## 10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdoses have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Effects have included severe nausea, severe vomiting, and severe hypoglycemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. In the event of an overdose of WEGOVY, consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. A prolonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of WEGOVY ®  of approximately 1 week.

## 11 DESCRIPTION

WEGOVY ®  contains semaglutide, a human GLP-1 receptor agonist (or GLP-1 analog). The peptide backbone is produced by yeast fermentation. The main protraction mechanism of semaglutide is albumin binding, facilitated by modification of position 26 lysine with a hydrophilic spacer and a C18 fatty di-acid. Furthermore, semaglutide is modified in position 8 to provide stabilization against degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4). A minor modification was made in position 34 to ensure the attachment of only one fatty di-acid. The molecular formula is C187H291N45O59 and the molecular weight is 4113.58 g/mol.

## Figure 1. Structural Formula of Semaglutide

<!-- image -->

WEGOVY ®  injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless solution. Each 0.5 mL single-dose pen contains a solution of WEGOVY ®  containing 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg or 1 mg of semaglutide; and each 0.75 mL single-dose pen contains a solution of WEGOVY ®  containing 1.7 or 2.4 mg of semaglutide. Each 1 mL of WEGOVY ®  contains the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; sodium chloride, 8.25 mg; and water for injection. WEGOVY ®  has a pH of approximately 7.4. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH.

WEGOVY ®  tablets include semaglutide as a white to almost white hygroscopic powder. Each tablet of WEGOVY ®  contains 1.5 mg, 4 mg, 9 mg or 25 mg of semaglutide and the following inactive ingredients: Salcaprozate sodium (SNAC) and magnesium stearate.

## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

## 12.1  Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1.

GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and caloric intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation. Animal studies show that semaglutide distributed to and activated neurons in brain regions involved in regulation of food intake.

The exact mechanism of semaglutide in CV risk reduction in adults has not been established.

For treatment of MASH in humans, the precise mechanism of action of semaglutide is not fully understood and may involve multiple pathways mediated by weight loss and other factors. In a mouse model of diet-induced MASH, treatment with semaglutide resulted in histological improvements in steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in liver compared to baseline, which was associated with body weight loss, intermittent periods of reduced food intake, and improvements in relevant biomarkers. The relationship between the pathophysiology of MASH in animal models and humans has not been fully established.

## 12.2  Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers body weight with greater fat mass loss than lean mass loss. Semaglutide decreases calorie intake. The effects are likely mediated by affecting appetite.

Semaglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose.

## Gastric Emptying

Semaglutide delays gastric emptying.

## Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide did not prolong QTc intervals at subcutaneous doses up to 1.5 mg at steady state.

## Noninvasive Liver Disease Markers

Semaglutide decreases liver fat content measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF), liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography (TE), Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score, and the levels of the pro-peptide of type III collagen biomarker (Pro-C3). The clinical relevance of these changes is yet to be confirmed.

## 12.3  Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

## WEGOVY® injection

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is 89% following subcutaneous administration. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 to 3 days post dose.

Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

The average semaglutide steady state concentration following subcutaneous administration of WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg once weekly was approximately 75 nmol/L in patients with obesity or overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 ). The steady state exposure concentrations increased proportionally with doses up to 2.4 mg once weekly.

## WEGOVY ®  Tablets

WEGOVY ®  tablets are co-formulated with SNAC which facilitates the absorption of semaglutide after oral WEGOVY ®  tablet administration. The absorption of semaglutide predominantly occurs in the stomach.

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is estimated to be approximately 1% to 2% following oral tablet administration. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 hour post dose.

The average semaglutide steady state concentration following 25 mg tablet oral administration was approximately 77 nmol/L in patients with obesity or overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 ). The steady-state concentrations increased approximately proportionally with doses up to 25 mg once daily.

In patients with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes, semaglutide concentrations following once-daily administration of oral WEGOVY ® 25 mg tablet are predicted to be comparable to WEGOVY ® 2.4 mg once-weekly injection, with higher variability in semaglutide concentrations compared to subcutaneous administration (90% of patients had average concentrations between 27 and 186 nmol/L with WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablet versus 51 and 110 nmol/L with WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg once-weekly injection).

Effect of Volume and Timing of Water Consumption: Single doses of oral semaglutide tablet were administered with 50 mL or 240 mL of water after an 8-hour overnight fast and a continued fast of 4 hours post-dose in healthy subjects. Semaglutide absorption [i.e., area under the curve (AUC) and peak concentrations (Cmax)] was higher following dosing with 50 mL water compared to that of 240 mL water.

For 10 days, healthy subjects received once daily doses of oral semaglutide with 50 mL or 120 mL of water under fasting conditions with post-dose fasting period of 15, 30, 60, or 120 minutes. In this study, semaglutide absorption (i.e., AUC and Cmax) was higher after a longer post-dose fasting period. There were no clinically significant differences in semaglutide absorption with administration of 50 mL or 120 mL of water.

## Distribution

The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration in patients with obesity or overweight is approximately 12.5 L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (greater than 99%) which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from degradation.

## Elimination

The apparent clearance of semaglutide in patients with overweight or obesity is approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 to 7 weeks after the last injectable dose of 2.4 mg or oral dose of 25 mg.

## Metabolism

The primary route of elimination for semaglutide is metabolism following proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid sidechain.

## Excretion

The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and feces. Approximately 3% of the dose is excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide.

## Specific Populations

Age, Sex, Race, Ethnicity, Body Weight, and Other Intrinsic Factors

No clinically significant differences in semaglutide pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (&lt;65 years, 65-74, ≥75 years old), sex, race (White, Asian, or Black or African American), ethnicity, body weight, upper GI disease (i.e. chronic gastritis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease), renal

impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 to &lt;90 mL/minute], or mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A-C) or fibrosis stage (F2 or F3 in patients with MASH). There is no difference observed in the exposure of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration of WEGOVY ®  between patients with MASH and patients with overweight or obesity.

## Patients with Type 2 Diabetes:

The average semaglutide steady state concentration following subcutaneous administration of WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg once weekly was approximately 68 nmol/L in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 ). The average semaglutide steady state concentration following 25 mg oral administration was approximately 44 nmol/L in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m 2 ) with higher variability in semaglutide concentrations compared to subcutaneous administration (90% of patients had average concentrations between 11 nmol/L and 134 nmol/L with WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablet versus 47 nmol/L and 99 nmol/L with WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg once-weekly injection) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

## Drug Interactions Studies

Subcutaneous Injection

The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

## Oral Tablets

Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches: The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Trials were conducted to study the potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of oral drugs taken with semaglutide tablets administered orally at steady-state exposure.

Levothyroxine: Total thyroxine (i.e., adjusted for endogenous levels) AUC of was increased by 33% following administration of a single dose of levothyroxine 600 mcg concomitantly administered with oral semaglutide. Maximum exposure (Cmax) was unchanged.

Other Drugs: No clinically significant differences in semaglutide pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with omeprazole. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were observed when used concomitantly with semaglutide: lisinopril, S-warfarin, R-warfarin, metformin, digoxin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, furosemide or rosuvastatin.

In Vitro Studies: Semaglutide has very low potential to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit drug transporters.

## 12.6  Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of semaglutide or of other semaglutide products.

During the 68-week treatment periods in Studies 2 and 3 in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], 50/1709 (3%) of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients developed anti-semaglutide antibodies (referred to as anti-drug-antibodies or ADA). Of these 50 WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients, 28 patients (2% of the total WEGOVY ®  injection-treated study population) developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. In adults with MASH treated with WEGOVY ®  for 72 weeks in Study 9 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], 3/763 (0.4%) of patients developed ADA which were also cross-reactive to native GLP-1. No identified clinically significant effect of ADA on pharmacokinetics for WEGOVY ®  injection was observed. There is insufficient evidence to characterize the effects of ADA on pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of semaglutide products.

## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

## 13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/day (2-, 8-, and 22-fold the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of WEGOVY ®  subcutaneous injection 2.4 mg/week, or WEGOVY ®  oral tablet 25 mg daily based on AUC) were administered to the males, and 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day (0.6-, 2-, and 5-fold MRHD) were administered to the females. A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas and a numerical increase in C-cell carcinomas were observed in males and females at all dose levels (greater than or equal to 0.6 times human exposure).

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.0025, 0.01, 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg/day were administered (below quantification, 0.2-, 0.4-, and 2-fold the exposure at the MRHD). A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas was observed in males and females at all dose levels, and a statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in males at greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures. Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in rats is unknown and could not be determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Semaglutide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests (bacterial mutagenicity [Ames] human lymphocyte chromosome aberration, rat bone marrow micronucleus).

In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03 and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.04-, 0.1-, and 0.4-fold the MRHD) were administered to male and female rats. Males were dosed for 4 weeks prior to mating, and females were dosed for 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout organogenesis until Gestation Day 17. No effects were observed on male fertility. In females, an increase in estrus-cycle length was observed at all dose levels, together with a small reduction in numbers of corpora lutea at greater than or equal to 0.03 mg/kg/day. These effects were likely an adaptive response secondary to the pharmacological effect of semaglutide on food consumption and body weight.

## 13.2  Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

The WEGOVY ®  tablet contains SNAC as an absorption enhancer. An increase in lactate levels and a decrease in glucose levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were observed in mechanistic studies with SNAC in rats. Small but statistically significant increases in lactate levels (up to 2-fold) were observed in a few animals at approximately the clinical exposure. At higher exposures these findings were associated with moderate to marked adverse clinical signs (lethargy, abnormal respiration, ataxia, and reduced activity, body tone and reflexes) and marked decreases in plasma and CSF glucose levels. These findings are consistent with inhibition of cellular respiration and lead to mortality at SNAC concentrations &gt;100-times the clinical Cmax.

## 14.1  Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Cardiovascular Disease and Either Obesity or Overweight

## Overview of Clinical Trial

Study 1 (NCT03574597) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine the effect of WEGOVY ®  injection relative to placebo on major adverse CV events (MACE) when added to current standard of care, which included management of CV risk factors and individualized healthy lifestyle counseling (including diet and physical activity) in adults with established CV disease and either obesity or overweight. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. During the 16-week dose escalation period, patients were titrated to WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly or placebo. Patients who could not tolerate the recommended escalation dosage, could stay at a lower dose level.

All patients were 45 years or older, with an initial BMI of 27 kg/m 2  or greater and established CV disease (prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke, or peripheral arterial disease). Patients with a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. Concomitant CV therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of the investigator, to ensure participants were treated according to the current standard of care for patients with established CV disease.

In this trial, 17,604 patients were randomized to WEGOVY ®  injection or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (range 45-93), 72% were male, 84% were White, 4% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian, and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. Mean baseline body weight was 97 kg and mean BMI was 33 kg/m 2 . At baseline, prior myocardial infarction was reported in 76% of randomized individuals, prior stroke in 23%, and peripheral arterial disease in 9%. Heart failure was reported in 24% of patients. At baseline, CV disease and risk factors were managed with lipidlowering therapy (90%), platelet aggregation inhibitors (86%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (74%), and beta blockers (70%). A total of 10% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and 0.4% had severe renal impairment eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m 2 .

## Results

In total, 96.9% of patients completed the trial, and vital status was available for 99.4% of patients. The median follow-up duration was 41.8 months. A total of 31% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 27% of placebo-treated patients permanently discontinued study drug. Of those patients on treatment at 1 year, 76% were on the 2.4 mg dose, 8% were on the 1.7 mg dose, and 16% were on lower doses. Of those patients on treatment at 2 years, 77% were on the 2.4 mg dose, 7% were on the 1.7 mg dose, and 17% were on lower doses.

For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for superiority. Type 1 error was controlled across multiple tests.

WEGOVY ®  injection significantly reduced the risk for first occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.80 (0.72, 0.90) (see Figure 2 and Table 5 ).

Data from the in-trial period. Cumulative incidence estimates are based on time from randomization to first EAC-confirmed cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke with non-CV death modeled as competing risk using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Patients without events of interest were censored at the end of their in-trial observation period. Time from randomization to first cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as categorical fixed factor. The hazard ratio and confidence interval are adjusted for the group sequential design using the likelihood ratio ordering. HR: Hazard ratio; CI: confidence interval; CV: cardiovascular

## 14.2 Weight Reduction and Long-term Maintenance Studies in Adults with Obesity or Overweight

Overview of Clinical Studies in Adults

The efficacy of WEGOVY ®  once weekly subcutaneous injection for weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity were studied in three 68-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; one 68-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo withdrawal trial; one 68-week, randomized, doubleblind trial that investigated 2 different doses of WEGOVY ®  injection versus placebo. In Studies 2 (NCT#03548935), 3 (NCT#03552757), and 4 (NCT#03611582), WEGOVY ®  or matching placebo was escalated to 2.4 mg subcutaneous injection weekly during a 16-week period followed by 52 weeks on maintenance dose. In Study 5 (NCT#03548987), WEGOVY ®  injection was escalated during a 20-week run-in period, and patients who reached a WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg subcutaneous injection weekly dosage after the run-in period were randomized to either continued treatment with WEGOVY ® injection or placebo for 48 weeks. In Study 6 (NCT#03811574), WEGOVY ®  injection was escalated to 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly dosages or placebo over 12 to 16 weeks followed by 52 weeks on either maintenance dose.

The efficacy  of  WEGOVY ®   25  mg  oral  once  daily  tablet  for  weight  reduction  and  long-term maintenance of body weight in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity was evaluated in a 64-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [Study 7 (NCT#05564117)]. WEGOVY ®  tablet or matching placebo was escalated to a 25 mg tablet once daily during a 12-week period followed by 52-week maintenance period.

In Studies 2, 3, 5 and 7, all patients received instruction for a reduced-calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and increased physical activity counseling (recommended to a minimum of 150 min/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial. In Study 4, patients received an initial 8-week low-calorie diet (total energy intake 1,000 to 1,200 kcal/day) followed by 60 weeks of a reduced-calorie diet (1200 to 1800 kcal/day) and increased physical activity (100 mins/week with gradual increase to 200 mins/week).

Study 2 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 1,961 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition, such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either WEGOVY ®  injection or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 46 years (range 18 to 86), 74% were female, 75% were White, 13% were Asian and 6% were Black or African American. A total of 12% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 105.3 kg and mean BMI was 37.9 kg/m 2 .

Study 3 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 807 patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m 2 . Patients included in the trial had HbA1c 7-10% and were treated with either: diet and exercise alone or 1 to 3 oral anti-diabetic drugs (metformin, sulfonylurea, glitazone or sodiumglucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either WEGOVY ® injection or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 55 years (range 19 to 84), 51% were female, 62% were White, 26% were Asian and 8% were Black or African American. A total of 13% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 99.8 kg and mean BMI was 35.7 kg/m 2 . Study 4 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 611 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. The patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either WEGOVY ®  injection or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 46 years, 81% were female, 76% were White, 19% were Black or African American and 2% were Asian. A total of 20% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 105.8 kg and mean BMI was 38 kg/m 2 .

Study 5 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 902 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Mean body weight at baseline for the 902 patients was 106.8 kg and mean BMI was 38.3 kg/m². All patients received WEGOVY ®  injection during the run-in period of 20 weeks that included 16 weeks of dose escalation. Trial product was permanently discontinued before randomization in 99 of 902 patients (11%); the most common reason was adverse reactions (n=48, 5.3%); 803 patients reached WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injection and were then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue on WEGOVY ®  injection or receive placebo. Among the 803 randomized patients, the mean age was 46

years, 79% were female, 84% were White, 13% were Black or African American, and 2% Asian. A total of 8% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean body weight at randomization (Week 20) was 96.1 kg and mean BMI at randomization (Week 20) was 34.4 kg/m 2 .

Study 6 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 401 East-Asian patients (Japan and South Korea) with BMI greater than or equal to 35 kg/m 2 and at least one weight-related comorbid condition or with BMI 27 to 34.9 kg/m 2  and at least two weight-related comorbid conditions. The patients were randomized 2:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injection of WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg, WEGOVY ®  1.7 mg, or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 51 years, 63% were male, and all patients were Asian. Mean baseline body weight was 87.5 kg and mean BMI was 31.9 kg/m 2 . At baseline, 24.7% of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Study 7 was a 64-week trial that enrolled 307 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI 27-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition, such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either WEGOVY ® 25 mg tablet or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 48 years, 79% were women, 92% were White, 1% were Asian and 7% were Black or African American. A total of 7.8% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 106 kg and mean BMI was 38 kg/m 2 .

## Results

In Studies 2, 3, and 4, 16% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 19% of the placebo-treated patients discontinued therapy. In these studies, 6.8% of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients and 3.2% of placebo-treated patients discontinued their treatment due to an adverse reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In Study 5, the proportions of patients who discontinued study drug were 5.8% and 11.6% for WEGOVY ®  injection and placebo, respectively. In Study 6, the proportions of patients who discontinued study drug were 7.9%, 6.5%, and 3% for WEGOVY ®  1.7 mg injection, WEGOVY ®  2.4 mg injection, and placebo, respectively. In Study 7, the proportions of patients who discontinued study drug were 18% and 25.5% for WEGOVY ®  25 mg tablet and placebo, respectively. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 6.8% of patients treated with WEGOVY ® 25 mg tablet and 5.9% patients receiving placebo.

For Studies 2, 3 and 4, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from baseline to Week 68.

After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY ®  injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY ® injection achieved 5%, 10% and 15% weight loss than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 7 .

For Study 5, the primary efficacy parameter was mean percent change in body weight from randomization (Week 20) to Week 68.

From randomization (week 20) to Week 68, treatment with WEGOVY ®  injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo ( Table 8 ). Because patients who discontinued WEGOVY ®  injection during titration and those who did not reach the 2.4 mg weekly

dose were not eligible for the randomized-treatment period, the results may not reflect the experience of patients in the general population who are first starting WEGOVY ®  injection.

kg. The intent-to-treat population includes all randomized patients. At Week 68, the body weight was missing for 2.8% and 6.7% of patients randomized to WEGOVY ®  injection and placebo, respectively. Missing data were imputed from retrieved subjects of the same randomized treatment arm (RD-MI). *p&lt;0.001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority, controlled for multiplicity.

For Study 6, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from baseline to Week 68. After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY ®  1.7 mg and 2.4 mg injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY ®  injection achieved 5%, 10%, and 15% weight loss than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 9 .

For Study 7, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from baseline to Week 64. After 64 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY ®  tablets resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY ®  tablets achieved 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% weight loss than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 10 .

A reduction in body weight was observed with WEGOVY ®  irrespective of age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg) at baseline, and level of renal function impairment.

The cumulative frequency distributions of change in body weight are shown in Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 for Studies 2, 3 and 7. One way to interpret this figure is to select a change in body weight of interest on the horizontal axis and note the corresponding proportions of patients (vertical axis) in each treatment group who achieved at least that degree of weight loss. For example, note that the vertical line arising from -10% in Study 2 intersects the WEGOVY ®  injection and placebo curves at approximately 66%, and 12%, respectively, which correspond to the values shown in Table 8 .

## 14.3  Weight Reduction and Long-term Maintenance Study of WEGOVY ®  Injection in Pediatric Patients Aged 12 Years and Older with Obesity

## Overview of Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients

WEGOVY ®  injection was evaluated to reduce excess body weight in pediatric patients aged 12 years of age and older with obesity in a 68-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebocontrolled, multi-center trial in 201 pubertal pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with BMI corresponding to ≥95th percentile standardized for age and sex (Study 8) (NCT#04102189). After a 12-week lifestyle run-in period (including dietary recommendations and physical activity counseling), patients were randomized 2:1 to WEGOVY ®  injection once weekly or placebo once weekly. WEGOVY ® injection or matching placebo was escalated to 2.4 mg or maximally tolerated dose during a 16-week period followed by 52 weeks on maintenance dose. Of WEGOVY ®  injection-treated patients who completed the trial, 86.7% were on the 2.4 mg dosage at the end of the trial; for 5% of patients, 1.7 mg was the maximum tolerated dosage.

The mean age was 15 years; 38% of patients were male; 79% were White, 8% were Black or African American, 2% were Asian, and 11% were of other or unknown race; and 11% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean baseline body weight was 108 kg, and mean BMI was 37 kg/m 2 .

## Results

The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug were 10% for the WEGOVY ®  injectiontreated group and 10% for the placebo-treated group.

The primary endpoint was percent change in BMI from baseline to Week 68. After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY ®  injection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in percent BMI compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY ®  injection achieved ≥5% reduction in baseline BMI than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 15 .

## 14.4  Noncirrhotic Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis with Moderate to Advanced Liver Fibrosis in Adults Treated with WEGOVY ®  Injection

Overview of Clinical Trial

The efficacy of WEGOVY ®  injection was evaluated based on an efficacy analysis at Week 72 in Study 9 (NCT#04822181), a 240-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled patients had a baseline or recent liver biopsy showing clinically significant MASLD (metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease), defined as MASH with fibrosis stage 2 or 3 and a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Activity Score (NAS) ≥4 with a score of 1 or more in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning. Efficacy determination was based on the effect of WEGOVY ® injection on resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of liver fibrosis and on at least one stage improvement in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis, on post-baseline liver biopsies collected at 72 weeks.

The Week 72 analysis included 800 F2 and F3 (at eligibility) patients randomized 1:2 to receive placebo (n=266) or WEGOVY ®  once weekly (n=534), in addition to standard of care for cardiometabolic comorbidities and healthy lifestyle counseling. WEGOVY ®  injection or matching placebo was escalated to 2.4 mg once weekly during the initial 16 weeks of the treatment period. Dose escalation could be prolonged or patients could remain at a lower dose if 2.4 mg once weekly was not tolerable. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment and placebo groups. Overall, the median (Q1 to Q3) age of patients at baseline was 57 (49 to 65) years, 57% were female, 18% were Hispanic, 68% were White, 27% were Asian, and 0.6% were Black or African American. Median (Q1 to Q3) body mass index (BMI) was 34 (30 to 38) kg/m 2  and median (Q1 to Q3) body weight was 93 (79 to 110) kg. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 17 .

Among the 79% of the patients with vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) at baseline, median (Q1 to Q3) VCTE was 10.9 (8.6 to 15.5) kPa, which may not be representative of the entire study population. The 21% of patients with missing VCTE at baseline had higher percentages of being female and having baseline diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

## Results

Table 18 presents the Week 72 histopathology primary endpoint results comparing WEGOVY ® injection with placebo on 1) the estimated percentage of patients with resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis and 2) the estimated percentage of patients with at least one stage improvement in liver fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis. The secondary endpoint results of the estimated percentage of patients with resolution of steatohepatitis and improvement in liver

fibrosis at Week 72 are also presented.

Endpoints were evaluated according to the MASH Clinical Research Network (CRN). Resolution of steatohepatitis is defined as a score of 0 to 1 for lobular inflammation, 0 for ballooning, and any value for steatosis. No worsening of steatohepatitis is defined as no increase from baseline in score for ballooning, lobular inflammation, or steatosis.

Estimated using pooled Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimates stratified by baseline type 2 diabetes status (presence or absence) and baseline fibrosis stage (F2 or F3) with missing data handled by reference-based multiple imputation and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Rubin's rule to pool Sato's estimate of standard errors across the imputed datasets.

Another secondary endpoint was the percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 72. Patients treated with WEGOVY ®  injection (mean baseline body weight 95.4 kg) achieved an average of 10.5% weight loss from baseline at Week 72, and patients treated with placebo (mean baseline weight 97.6 kg) achieved an average of 2% weight loss from baseline at Week 72; treatment with WEGOVY ®  injection resulted in an average of 8.5% greater weight loss from baseline compared to placebo (95% CI: 7.4% to 9.5%).

Starting at Week 12 and through Week 72, there was a trend of greater reductions from baseline in average ALT and AST in the WEGOVY ®  injection group as compared to the placebo group.

## How to use your WEGOVY ®  pen

## Do not use your WEGOVY ®  pen without receiving training

from your healthcare provider. Make sure that you or your caregiver know how to give an injection with the pen before you start your treatment.

Read and follow the instructions so that you use your WEGOVY ®  pen correctly:

## Preparation

## Step 1. Prepare for your injection.

- Supplies you will need to give your WEGOVY ® injection:
- WEGOVY ®  pen
- 1 alcohol swab or soap and water
- 1 gauze pad or cotton ball
- 1 sharps disposable container for used WEGOVY ® pens
- Wash your hands.
- Check your WEGOVY ®  pen.

Do not use your WEGOVY ®  pen if:

-   The pen appears to have been used or any part of the pen appears broken, for example if it has been dropped.
-   The WEGOVY ®  medicine is not clear and colorless through the pen window.
- The expiration date (EXP) has passed.

Contact Novo Nordisk at 1-833-934-6891 if your WEGOVY ®  pen fails any of these checks.

## Step 2. Choose your injection site.

- Your healthcare provider can help you choose the injection site that is best for you
-   You may inject into your upper leg (front of the thighs), lower stomach (keep 2 inches away from your belly button) or upper arm.
- Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks.
- You may inject in the same body area each week, but make sure it is not in the same spot each time.

Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab or soap and water. Do not touch the injection site after cleaning. Allow the skin to dry before injecting.

## Throw away pen

Step 5. Throw away (dispose of) pen.

Safely dispose of the WEGOVY ®  pen right away after each use. See 'How do I throw away (dispose of) WEGOVY ® pens?'

## • What if blood appears after injection?

If blood appears at the injection site, press the site lightly with a gauze pad or cotton ball.

## Troubleshooting

<!-- image -->

- If you have problems injecting, change to a more firm injection site, such as upper leg, or upper arm or consider standing up while injecting into the lower stomach.
- If medicine appears on the skin or squirts from the needle, make sure the next time you inject to keep applying pressure until the yellow bar has stopped moving. Then you can lift the pen slowly from your skin.

How do I throw away (dispose of) WEGOVY ®  pens? Put the used WEGOVY ®  pen in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the pen in your household trash.

If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:

- made of a heavy-duty plastic,
- able to be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,
- upright and stable during use,
- leak-resistant, and
- properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.

When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.

- Do not reuse the pen.
- Do not recycle the pen or sharps disposal container, or throw them into household trash.

Important: Keep your WEGOVY ®  pen, sharps disposal container and all medicines out of the reach of children.

## How do I care for my pen?

## Protect your pen

- Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces.
- Do not expose your pen to any liquids.
- If you think that your pen may be damaged, do not try to fix it. Use a new one.
- Keep the pen cap on until you are ready to inject. Your pen will no longer be sterile if you store an unused pen without the cap, if you pull the pen cap off and put it on again, or if the pen cap is missing. This could lead to an infection.
