For concerns or issues if you are greater than 16 weeks pregnant

Release of Information Unit (Assists with all disability/leave related needs) Your provider will complete the first maternity leave note (otherwise known as an off work note). Please visit www.kp.org/requestrecords to file for disability claims (including State/FMLA/baby bonding), submit your disability receipt number, and/or any forms that need to be completed by your provider. Disability forms will not be filled out by your provider in the clinic, even if they just require a signature. If you are not active on kp.org, we encourage you to sign up. For issues, please contact our Orange County Release of Information Unit.
