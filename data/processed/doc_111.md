## Instructions for Health Care Providers

'Health care provider' is defined by law in RCW 50A.05.010 and WAC 192-500-090.

Paid Leave medical certification forms are used to certify a serious health condition to qualify for Paid Family and Medical Leave. Your patient may be applying due to their own serious health condition, their pregnancy, or to care for a family member with a serious health condition. Our Certification of Birth form can be used for the first six weeks of medical leave to recover from giving birth and for family leave to bond with a new baby.

What to do when you receive a form: Fill out Section 2. Within 7 calendar days of receipt, return the form to your patient (they will share it with us). You cannot charge a fee for completing the form.

## SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION

- Continuing treatment by a health care provider including any of the following:
- Incapacity: A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive days and subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition.
