In modern times, improvements in knowledge and technological advances have greatly improved the health of mother and children. However, the past decade was marked by limited progress in reducing maternal mortality and a slow-down in the steady decline of childhood mortality observed since the mid 1950s in many countries, the latter being largely due to a failure to reduce neonatal mortality.

Every year, over four million babies less than one month of age die, most of them during the critical first week of life; and for every newborn who dies, another is stillborn. Most of these deaths are a consequence of the poor health and nutritional status of the mother coupled with inadequate care before, during, and after delivery. Unfortunately, the problem remains unrecognized or- worse- accepted as inevitable in many societies, in large part because it is so common.

Recognizing the large burden of maternal and neonatal ill-health on the development capacity of individuals, communities and societies, world leaders reaffirmed their commitment to invest in mothers and children by adopting specific goals and targets to reduce maternal and childhood-infant mortality as part of the Millennium Declaration.

There is a widely shared but mistaken idea that improvements in newborn health require sophisticated and expensive technologies and highly specialized staff. The reality is that many conditions that result in perinatal death can be prevented or treated without sophisticated and expensive technology. What is required is essential care during pregnancy, the assistance of a person with midwifery skills during childbirth and the immediate postpartum period, and a few critical interventions for the newborn during the first days of life.

It is against this background that we are proud to present the document Pregnancy, Childbirth, Postpartum and Newborn Care: A guide for essential practice , as new additions to the Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth tool kit.  The guide provides a full range of updated, evidence-based norms and standards that will enable health care providers to give high quality care during pregnancy, delivery and in the postpartum period, considering the needs of the mother and her newborn baby.

We hope that the guide will be helpful for decision-makers, programme managers and health care providers in charting out their roadmap towards meeting the health needs of all mothers and children. We have the knowledge, our major challenge now is to translate this into action and to reach those women and children who are most in need.

## InTrOducTIOn

The aim of Pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and newborn care guide for essential practice  (PCPNC) is to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide health care professionals in the management of women during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum, and post abortion, and newborns during their first week of life, including management of endemic diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB and anaemia.

All recommendations are for skilled attendants working at the primary level of health care, either at the facility or in the community. They apply to all women attending antenatal care, in delivery,  postpartum or post abortion care, or who come for emergency care, and to all newborns at birth and during the first week of life (or later) for routine and emergency care.

The PCPNC is a guide for clinical decision-making. It facilitates the collection, analysis, classification and use of relevant information by suggesting key questions, essential observations and/or examinations, and recommending appropriate research-based interventions. It promotes the early detection of complications and the initiation of early and appropriate treatment, including timely referral, if necessary.

Correct use of this guide should help reduce the high maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity rates prevalent in many parts of the developing world, thereby making pregnancy and childbirth safer.

The guide is not designed for immediate use. It is a generic guide and should first be adapted to local needs and resources. It should cover the most serious endemic conditions that the skilled birth attendant must be able to treat, and be made consistent with national treatment guidelines and other policies. It is accompanied by an adaptation guide to help countries prepare their own national guides and training and other supporting materials.

The first section, How to use the guide, describes how the guide is organized, the overall content and presentation.  Each chapter begins with a short description of how to read and use it, to help the reader use the guide correctly.

The Guide has been developed by the Department of Reproductive Health and Research with contributions from the following WHO programmes:

- ■ Child and Adolesscent Health and Development
- ■ HIV/AIDS
- ■ Nutrition for Health and Development
- ■ Essential drugs and Medicines Policy
- ■ Vaccines and Biologicals
- ■ Communicable Diseases Control, Prevention and Eradication (tuberculosis, malaria, helminthiasis)
- ■ Gender and Women's Health
- ■ Mental Health and Substance Dependence
- ■ Blindness and Deafness

## HOW TO reAd THe guIde

## Content

The Guide includes routine and emergency care for women and newborns during pregnancy, labour and delivery, postpartum and post abortion, as well as key preventive measures required to reduce the incidence of endemic and other diseases like malaria, anaemia, HIV/AIDS and TB, which add to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Most women and newborns using the services described in the Guide are not ill and/or do not have complications. They are able to wait in line when they come for a scheduled visit. However, the small proportion of women/newborns who are ill, have complications or are in labour, need urgent attention and care.

## The clinical content is divided into six sections which are as follows:

- ■ Quick check (triage), emergency management (called Rapid Assessment and Management or RAM) and referral, followed by a chapter on emergency treatments for the woman.
- ■ Post-abortion care.
- ■ Antenatal care.
- ■ Labour and delivery.
- ■ Postpartum care.
- ■ Newborn care.

In each of the six clinical sections listed above there is a series of flow, treatment and information charts which include:

- ■ Guidance on routine care, including monitoring the well-being of the mother and/ or baby.
- ■ Early detection and management of complications.
- ■ Preventive measures.
- ■ Advice and counselling.

## In addition to the clinical care outlined above, other sections in the guide include:

- ■ Advice on HIV, prevention and treatment.
- ■ Support for women with special needs.
- ■ Links with the community.
- ■ Drugs, supplies, equipment, universal precautions and laboratory tests.
- ■ Examples of clinical records.
- ■ Counselling and key messages for women and families.
- There is an important section at the beginning of the Guide entitled Principles of good care A1-A5 .  This includes principles of good care for all women, including those with special needs. It explains the organization of each visit to a healthcare facility, which applies to overall care. The principles are not repeated for each visit.

Recommendations for the management of complications at secondary (referral) health care level can be found in the following guides for midwives and doctors:

- ■ Managing complications of pregnancy and childbirth (WHO/RHR/00.7)
- ■ Managing newborn problems.

## sTrucTure And PresenTATIOn

This Guide is a tool for clinical decision-making. The content is presented in a frame work of coloured flow charts supported by information and treatment charts which give further details of care.

The framework is based on a syndromic approach whereby the skilled attendant identifies a limited number of key clinical signs and symptoms, enabling her/him to classify the condition according to severity and give appropriate treatment. Severity is marked in colour: red for emergencies, yellow for less urgent conditions which nevertheless need attention, and green for normal care.

SIGNS

<!-- image -->

## Flow charts

The flow charts include the following information:

1. Key questions to be asked.
2. Important observations and examinations to be made.
3. Possible findings (signs) based on information elicited from the questions, observations and, where appropriate, examinations.
4. Classification of the findings.
5. Treatment and advice related to the signs and classification.

'T reat,   ad vise'   means giving the treatment indicated (performing a procedure, prescribing drugs or other treatments, advising on possible side-effects and how to overcome them) and giving advice on other important practices.   The treat and advise column is often crossreferenced to other treatment and/or information charts. T urn to these charts for more information.

TREAT AND ADVISE

<!-- image -->

ASK, CHECK RECORD LOOK, LISTEN FEEL

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Use of colour

Colour is used in the flow charts to indicate the severity of a condition.

6. Green usually indicates no abnormal condition and therefore normal care is given, as outlined in the guide, with appropriate advice for home care and follow up.
7. Yellow indicates that there is a problem that can be treated without referral.
8. Red highlights an emergency which requires immediate treatment and, in most cases, urgent referral to a higher level health facility.

## Key sequential steps

The charts for normal and abnormal deliveries are presented in a framework of key sequential steps for a clean safe delivery. The key sequential steps for delivery are in a column on the left side of the page, while the column on the right has interventions which may be required if problems arise during delivery. Interventions may be linked to relevant treatment and/or information pages, and are cross-referenced to other parts of the Guide.

## Treatment and information pages

The flow charts are linked (cross-referenced) to relevant treatment and/or information pages in other parts of the Guide.  These pages include information which is too detailed to include in the flow charts:

- ■ Treatments.
- ■ Advice and counselling.
- ■ Preventive measures.
- ■ Relevant procedures.

## Information and counselling

## sheets

These contain appropriate advice and counselling messages to provide to the woman, her partner and family. In addition, a section is included at the back of the Guide to support the skilled attendant in this effort. Individual sheets are provided with simplified versions of the messages on care during pregnancy (preparing a birth and emergency plan, clean home delivery, care for the mother and baby after delivery, breastfeeding and care after an abortion) to be given to the mother, her partner and family at the appropriate stage of pregnancy and childbirth.

These sheets are presented in a generic format. They will require adaptation to local conditions and language, and the addition of illustrations to enhance understanding, acceptability and attractiveness. Different programmes may prefer a different format such as a booklet or flip chart.

## AssumPTIOns underlyIng  THe guIde

Recommendations in the Guide are generic, made on many assumptions about the health characteristics of the population and the health care system (the setting, capacity and organization of services, resources and staffing).

## Population and endemic conditions

- ■ High maternal and perinatal mortality
- ■ Many adolescent pregnancies
- ■ High prevalence of endemic conditions: → Anaemia
- → Stable transmission of falciparum malaria
- → Hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale)
- → Sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS
- → Vitamin A and iron/folate deficiencies.

## Health care system

The Guide assumes that:

- ■ Routine and emergency pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care are provided at the primary level of the health care, e.g. at the facility near where the woman lives.  This facility could be a health post, health centre or maternity clinic. It could also be a hospital with a delivery ward and outpatient clinic providing routine care to women from the neighbourhood.
- ■ A single skilled attendant is providing care. She may work at the health care centre, a maternity unit of a hospital or she may go

to the woman's home, if necessary. However there may be other health workers who receive the woman or support the skilled attendant when emergency complications occur.

- ■ Human resources, infrastructure, equipment, supplies and drugs are limited. However, essential drugs, IV fluids, supplies, gloves and essential equipment are available.
- ■ If a health worker with higher levels of skill (at the facility or a referral hospital) is providing pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care to women other than those referred, she follows the recommendations described in this Guide.
- ■ Routine visits and follow-up visits are 'scheduled' during office hours.
- ■ Emergency services ('unscheduled' visits) for labour and delivery, complications, or severe illness or deterioration are provided 24/24 hours, 7 days a week.
- ■ Women and babies with complications or expected complications are referred for further care to the secondary level of care, a referral hospital.
- ■ Referral and transportation are appropriate for the distance and other circumstances. They must be safe for the mother and the baby.
- ■ Some deliveries are conducted at home, attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) or relatives, or the woman delivers alone (but home delivery without a skilled attendant is not recommended).
- ■ Links with the community and traditional providers are established. Primary health care

services and the community are involved in maternal and newborn health issues.

- ■ Other programme activities, such as management of malaria, tuberculosis and other lung diseases, treatment for HIV, and infant feeding counselling, that require specific training, are delivered by a different provider, at the same facility or at the referral hospital. Detection, initial treatment and referral are done by the skilled attendant.
- ■ All pregnant woman are routinely offered HIV testing and counselling at the first contact with the health worker, which could be during the antenatal visits, in early labour or in the postpartum period.

Women who are first seen by the health worker in late labour are offered the test after the childbirth.

Health workers are trained to provide HIV testing and counselling. HIV testing kits and ARV medicines are available at the Primary health-care

## Knowledge and skills of care providers

This Guide assumes that professionals using it have the knowledge and skills in providing the care it describes. Other training materials must be used to bring the skills up to the level assumed by the Guide.

## Adaptation of the Guide

It is essential that this generic Guide is adapted to national and local situations, not only within the context of existing health priorities and resources, but also within the context of respect and sensitivity to the needs of women, newborns and the communities to which they belong.

An adaptation guide is available to assist national experts in modifying the Guide according to national needs, for different demographic and epidemiological conditions, resources and settings. The adaptation guide offers some alternatives. It includes guidance on developing information and counselling tools so that each programme manager can develop a format which is most comfortable for her/him.

## PrinciPles of good cAre

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

These principles of good care apply to all contacts between the skilled attendant and all women and their babies; they are not repeated in each section. Care-givers should therefore familiarize themselves with the following principles before using the Guide. The principles concern:

- ■
- Communication A2 .
- ■ Workplace and administrative procedures
- ■ Standard precautions and cleanliness
- ■
- Organizing a visit A5 .

## communicAtion

## Communicating with the woman (and her companion)

- ■ Make the woman (and her companion) feel welcome.
- ■ Be friendly, respectful and non-judgmental at all times.
- ■ Use simple and clear language.
- ■ Encourage her to ask questions.
- ■ Ask and provide information related to her needs.
- ■ Support her in understanding her options and making decisions.
- ■ At any examination or before any procedure: → seek her permission and
- → inform her of what you are doing.
- ■ Summarize the most important information, including the information on routine laboratory tests and treatments.

Verify that she understands emergency signs, treatment instructions, and when and where to return. Check for understanding by asking her to explain or demonstrate treatment instructions.

## Privacy and confidentiality

In all contacts with the woman and her partner:

- ■ Ensure a private place for the examination and counselling.
- ■ Ensure, when discussing sensitive subjects, that you cannot be overheard.
- ■ Make sure you have the woman's consent before discussing with her partner or family.
- ■ Never discuss confidential information about clients with other providers, or outside the health facility.
- ■ Organize the examination area so that, during examination, the woman is protected from the view of other people (curtain, screen, wall).
- ■ Ensure all records are confidential and kept locked away.
- ■ Limit access to logbooks and registers to responsible providers only.

## Prescribing and recommending treatments and preventive measures for the woman and/or her baby

When giving a treatment (drug, vaccine, bednet, condom) at the clinic, or prescribing measures to be followed at home:

- ■ Explain to the woman what the treatment is and why it should be given.
- ■ Explain to her that the treatment will not harm her or her baby, and that not taking it may be more dangerous.
- ■ Give clear and helpful advice on how to take the drug regularly:
- → for example: take 2 tablets 3 times a day, thus every 8 hours, in the morning, afternoon and evening with some water and after a meal, for 5 days.
- ■ Demonstrate the procedure.
- ■ Explain how the treatment is given to the baby. Watch her as she does the first treatment in the clinic.
- ■ Explain the side-effects to her. Explain that they are not serious, and tell her how to manage them.
- ■ Advise her to return if she has any problems or concerns about taking the drugs.
- ■ Explore any barriers she or her family may have, or have heard from others, about using the treatment, where possible:
- → Has she or anyone she knows used the treatment or preventive measure before?
- → Were there problems?
- → Reinforce the correct information that she has, and try to clarify the incorrect information.
- ■ Discuss with her the importance of buying and taking the prescribed amount. Help her to think about how she will be able to purchase this.

## WorkPlAce And AdministrAtive Procedures

## Workplace

- ■ Service hours should be clearly posted.
- ■ Be on time with appointments or inform the woman/women if she/they need to wait.
- ■ Before beginning the services, check that equipment is clean and functioning and that supplies and drugs are in place.
- ■ Keep the facility clean by regular cleaning.
- ■ At the end of the service:
- → discard litter and sharps safely
- → prepare for disinfection; clean and disinfect equipment and supplies
- → replace linen, prepare for washing
- → replenish supplies and drugs
- → ensure routine cleaning of all areas.
- ■ Hand over essential information to the colleague who follows on duty.

## Daily and occasional administrative activities

- ■ Keep records of equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines.
- ■ Check availability and functioning of essential equipment (order stocks of supplies, drugs, vaccines and contraceptives before they run out).
- ■ Establish staffing lists and schedules.
- ■ Complete periodic reports on births, deaths and other indicators as required, according to instructions.

## Record keeping

- ■ Always record findings on a clinical record and home-based record. Record treatments, reasons for referral, and follow-up recommendations at the time the observation is made.
- ■ Do not record confidential information on the home-based record if the woman is unwilling.
- ■ Maintain and file appropriately:
- → all clinical records
- → all other documentation.

## International conventions

The health facility should not allow distribution of free or low-cost suplies or products within the scope of the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. It should also be tobacco free and support a tobacco-free environment.

## stAndArd PrecAutions And cleAnliness

observe these precautions to protect the woman and her baby, and you as the health provider, from infections with bacteria and viruses, including Hiv.

## Wash hands

- ■ Wash hands with soap and water:
- → Before and after caring for a woman or newborn, and before any treatment procedure
- → Whenever the hands (or any other skin area) are contaminated with blood or other body fluids
- → After removing the gloves, because they may have holes
- → After changing soiled bedsheets or clothing.
- ■ Keep nails short.

## Wear gloves

- ■ Wear sterile or highly disinfected gloves when performing vaginal examination, delivery , cord cutting, repair of episiotomy or tear, blood drawing.
- ■ Wear long sterile or highly disinfected gloves for manual removal of placenta.
- ■ Wear clean gloves when:
- → Handling and cleaning instruments
- → Handling contaminated waste
- → Cleaning blood and body fluid spills
- ■ Drawing blood.

## Protect yourself from blood and other body fluids during deliveries

- → Wear gloves; cover any cuts, abrasions or broken skin with a waterproof bandage; take care when handling any sharp instruments (use good light); and practice safe sharps disposal.
- → Wear a long apron made from plastic or other fluid resistant material, and shoes.
- → If possible, protect your eyes from splashes of blood.

## Practice safe sharps disposal

- ■ Keep a puncture resistant container nearby.
- ■ Use each needle and syringe only once.
- ■ Do not recap, bend or break needles after giving an injection.
- ■ Drop all used (disposable) needles, plastic syringes and blades directly into this container, without recapping, and without passing to another person.
- ■ Empty or send for incineration when the container is three-quarters full.

## Practice safe waste disposal

- ■ Dispose of placenta or blood, or body fluid contaminated items, in leak-proof containers.
- ■ Burn or bury contaminated solid waste.
- ■ Wash hands, gloves and containers after disposal of infectious waste.
- ■ Pour liquid waste down a drain or flushable toilet.
- ■ Wash hands after disposal of infectious waste.

## Deal with contaminated laundry

- ■ Collect clothing or sheets stained with blood or body fluids and keep them separately from other laundry, wearing gloves or use a plastic bag. do not touch them directly.
- ■ Rinse off blood or other body fluids before washing with soap.

## Sterilize and clean contaminated equipment

- ■ Make sure that instruments which penetrate the skin (such as needles) are adequately sterilized, or that single-use instruments are disposed of after one use.
- ■ Thoroughly clean or disinfect any equipment which comes into contact with intact skin (according to instructions).
- ■ Use bleach for cleaning bowls and buckets, and for blood or body fluid spills.

## Clean and disinfect gloves

- ■ Wash the gloves in soap and water.
- ■ Check for damage: Blow gloves full of air, twist the cuff closed, then hold under clean water and look for air leaks. Discard if damaged.
- ■ Soak overnight in bleach solution with 0.5% available chlorine (made by adding 90 ml water to 10 ml bleach containing 5% available chlorine).
- ■ Dry away from direct sunlight.
- ■ Dust inside with talcum powder or starch.

This produces disinfected gloves.  They are not sterile.

Good quality latex gloves can be disinfected 5 or more times.

## Sterilize gloves

- ■ Sterilize by autoclaving or highly disinfect by steaming or boiling.

## orgAnizing A visit

## Receive and respond immediately

receive every woman and newborn baby seeking care immediately after arrival (or organize reception by another provider).

<!-- image -->

- ■ Perform Quick Check on all new incoming women and babies and those in the waiting room, especially if no-one is receiving them B2 .
- ■ At the first emergency sign on Quick Check, begin emergency assessment and management (RAM) B-B7 for the woman, or examine the newborn J-J .
- ■ If she is in labour, accompany her to an appropriate place and follow the steps as in Childbirth: labour, delivery and immediate postpartum care d-d29 .
- ■ If she has priority signs, examine her immediately using Antenatal care , Postpartum or Post-abortion care charts c-c9 e-e0 B8-B22 .
- ■ If no emergency or priority sign on RAM or not in labour, invite her to wait in the waiting room.
- ■ If baby is newly born, looks small, examine immediately. Do not let the mother wait in the queue.

## Begin each emergency care visit

- ■ Introduce yourself.
- ■ Ask the name of the woman.
- ■ Encourage the companion to stay with the woman.
- ■ Explain all procedures, ask permission, and keep the woman informed as much as
- you can about what you are doing. If she is unconscious, talk to the companion.
- ■ Ensure and respect privacy during examination and discussion.
- ■ If she came with a baby and the baby is well, ask the companion to take care of the baby during the maternal examination and treatment.

## Care of woman or baby referred for special care to secondary level facility

- ■ When a woman or baby is referred to a secondary level care facility because of a specific problem or complications, the underlying assumption of the Guide is that, at referral level, the woman/baby will be assessed, treated, counselled and advised on follow-up for that particular condition/ complication.
- ■ Follow-up for that specific condition will be either:
- → organized by the referral facility or
- → written instructions will be given to the woman/baby for the skilled attendant at the primary level who referred the woman/ baby.
- → the woman/baby will be advised to go for a follow-up visit within 2 weeks according to severity of the condition.
- ■ Routine care continues at the primary care level where it was initiated.

## Begin each routine visit (for the woman and/or the baby)

- ■ Greet the woman and offer her a seat.
- ■ Introduce yourself.
- ■ Ask her name (and the name of the baby).
- ■ Ask her:
- → Why did you come? For yourself or for your baby?
- → For a scheduled (routine) visit?
- → For specific complaints about you or your baby?
- → First or follow-up visit?
- → Do you want to include your companion or other family member (parent if adolescent) in the examination and discussion?
- ■ If the woman is recently delivered, assess the baby or ask to see the baby if not with the mother.
- ■ If antenatal care, always revise the birth plan at the end of the visit after completing the chart.
- ■ For a postpartum visit, if she came with the baby, also examine the baby:
- → Follow the appropriate charts according to pregnancy status/age of the baby and purpose of visit.
- → Follow all steps on the chart and in relevant boxes.
- ■ Unless the condition of the woman or the baby requires urgent referral to hospital, give preventive measures if due even if the woman has a condition "in yellow" that requires special treatment.
- ■ If follow-up visit is within a week, and if no other complaints:
- → Assess the woman for the specific condition requiring follow-up only
- → Compare with earlier assessment and reclassify.
- ■ If a follow-up visit is more than a week after the initial examination (but not the next scheduled visit):
- → Repeat the whole assessment as required for an antenatal, post-abortion, postpartum or newborn visit according to the schedule
- → If antenatal visit, revise the birth plan.

## During the visit

- ■ Explain all procedures,
- ■ Ask permission before undertaking an examination or test.
- ■ Keep the woman informed throughout. Discuss findings with her (and her partner).
- ■ Ensure privacy during the examination and discussion.

## At the end of the visit

- ■ Ask the woman if she has any questions.
- ■ Summarize the most important messages with her.
- ■ Encourage her to return for a routine visit (tell her when) and if she has any concerns.
- ■ Fill the Home-Based Maternal Record (HBMR) and give her the appropriate information sheet.
- ■ Ask her if there are any points which need to be discussed and would she like support for this.

## airway, BrEathing and circulation

## Manage	the	airway	and	breathing

If	the	woman	has	great	difficulty	breathing	and:

- ■ If	you	suspect	obstruction:
- → T r y	to	clear	the	airway	and	dislodge	obstruction
- → Help	the	woman	to	find	the	best	position	for	breathing
- → urgently refer the woman to hospital.
- ■ If	the	woman	is	unconscious:
- → Keep	her	on	her	back,	arms	at	the	side
- → Tilt	her	head	backwards	(unless	trauma	is	suspected)
- → Lift	her	chin	to	open	airway
- → Inspect	her	mouth	for	foreign	body;	remove	if	found
- → Clear	secretions	from	throat.
- ■ If	the	woman	is	not	breathing:
- → V entilate	with	bag	and	mask	until	she	starts	breathing	spontaneously
- ■ If	woman	still	has	great	difficulty	breathing,	keep	her	propped	up,	and
- ■ refer the woman urgently to hospital.

## Insert	IV	line	and	give	fluids

- ■ Wash	hands	with	soap	and	water	and	put	on	gloves.
- ■ Clean	woman's	skin	with	spirit	at	site	for	IV	line.
- ■ Insert	an	intravenous	line	(IV	line)	using	a	16-18	gauge	needle.
- ■ Attach	Ringer's	lactate	or	normal	saline.	Ensure	infusion	is	running	well.

Give	fluids	at rapid rate if	shock,	systolic	BP&lt;90	mmHg,	pulse&gt;110/minute,	or	heavy	vaginal	bleeding:

- ■ Infuse	1	litre	in	15-20	minutes	(as	rapid	as	possible).
- ■ Infuse	1	litre	in	30	minutes	at	30	ml/minute.	Repeat	if	necessary.
- ■ Monitor	every	15	minutes	for:
- → blood	pressure	(BP)	and	pulse
- → shortness	of	breath	or	puffiness.
- ■ Reduce	the	infusion	rate	to	3	ml/minute	(1	litre	in	6-8	hours)	when	pulse	slows	to	less	than	100/ minute,	systolic	BP	increases	to	100	mmHg	or	higher.
- ■ Reduce	the	infusion	rate	to	0.5	ml/minute	if	breathing	difficulty	or	puffiness	develops.
- ■ Monitor	urine	output.
- ■ Record	time	and	amount	of	fluids	given.

Give	fluids	at moderate rate if	severe	abdominal	pain,	obstructed	labour,	ectopic	pregnancy,	dangerous fever	or	dehydration:

- ■ Infuse	1	litre	in	2-3	hours.

Give	fluids	at slow rate if	severe	anaemia/severe	pre-eclampsia	or	eclampsia:

- ■ Infuse	1	litre	in	6-8	hours.

## If	intravenous	access	not	possible

- ■ Give	oral	rehydration	solution	(ORS)	by	mouth	if	able	to	drink,	or	by	nasogastric	(NG)	tube.
- ■ Quantity	of	ORS:	300	to	500	ml	in	1	hour.

do not give	ORS	to	a	woman	who	is	unconscious	or	has	convulsions.

## BlEEding

## Massage	uterus	and	expel	clots

If	heavy	postpartum	bleeding	persists	after	placenta	is	delivered,	or	uterus	is	not	well	contracted	(is	soft):

- ■ Place	cupped	palm	on	uterine	fundus	and	feel	for	state	of	contraction.
- ■ Massage	fundus	in	a	circular	motion	with	cupped	palm	until	uterus	is	well	contracted.
- ■ When	well	contracted,	place	fingers	behind	fundus	and	push	down	in	one	swift	action	to	expel	clots.
- ■ Collect	blood	in	a	container	placed	close	to	the	vulva.	Measure	or	estimate	blood	loss,	and	record.

## Apply	bimanual	uterine	compression

If	heavy	postpartum	bleeding	persists	despite	uterine	massage,	oxytocin/ergometrine	treatment	and removal	of	placenta:

- ■ Wear	sterile	or	clean	gloves.
- ■ Introduce	the	right	hand	into	the	vagina,	clenched	fist,	with	the	back	of	the	hand	directed	posteriorly and	the	knuckles	in	the	anterior	fornix.
- ■ Place	the	other	hand	on	the	abdomen	behind	the	uterus	and	squeeze	the	uterus	firmly	between	the two	hands.
- ■ Continue	compression	until	bleeding	stops	(no	bleeding	if	the	compression	is	released).
- ■ If	bleeding	persists,	apply	aortic	compression	and	transport	woman	to	hospital.

## Apply	aortic	compression

If	heavy	postpartum	bleeding	persists	despite	uterine	massage,	oxytocin/ergometrine	treatment	and removal	of	placenta:

- ■ Feel	for	femoral	pulse.
- ■ Apply	pressure	above	the	umbilicus	to	stop	bleeding.	Apply	sufficient	pressure	until	femoral	pulse	is	not	felt.
- ■ After	finding	correct	site,	show	assistant	or	relative	how	to	apply	pressure,	if	necessary.
- ■ Continue	pressure	until	bleeding	stops.	If	bleeding	persists,	keep	applying	pressure	while	transporting woman	to	hospital.

## Give	oxytocin

If	heavy	postpartum	bleeding

| initial dose     | continuing dose                                                 | maximum dose                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

## Give	ergometrine

If	heavy	bleeding	in	early	pregnancy	or postpartum	bleeding	(after	oxytocin)	but do not give if eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, or hypertension

| initial dose        | continuing dose                                                  | maximum dose                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| IM/IV:0.2 mg slowly | IM: repeat 0.2 mg IM after 15 minutes if heavy bleeding persists | Not more than 5 doses (total 1.0 mg) |

## Remove	placenta	and	fragments	manually

- ■ If	placenta	not	delivered	1	hour	after	delivery	of	the	baby,	OR
- ■ If	heavy	vaginal	bleeding	continues	despite	massage	and	oxytocin	and	placenta	cannot	be	delivered by	controlled	cord	traction,	or	if	placenta	is	incomplete	and	bleeding	continues.

## preparation

- ■ Explain	to	the	woman	the	need	for	manual	removal	of	the	placenta	and	obtain	her	consent.
- ■ Insert	an	IV	line.	If	bleeding,	give	fluids	rapidly.	If	not	bleeding,	give	fluids	slowly B .
- ■ Assist	woman	to	get	onto	her	back.
- ■ Give	diazepam	(10-mg	IM/IV).
- ■ Clean	vulva	and	perineal	area.
- ■ Ensure	the	bladder	is	empty.	Catheterize	if	necessary B12 .
- ■ Wash	hands	and	forearms	well	and	put	on	long	sterile	gloves	(and	an	apron	or	gown	if	available).

## technique

- ■ With	the	left	hand,	hold	the	umbilical	cord	with	the	clamp.	Then	pull	the	cord	gently	until	it	is horizontal.
- ■ Insert	right	hand	into	the	vagina	and	up	into	the	uterus.
- ■ Leave	the	cord	and	hold	the	fundus	with	the	left	hand	in	order	to	support	the	fundus	of	the	uterus and	to	provide	counter-traction	during	removal.
- ■ Move	the	fingers	of	the	right	hand	sideways	until	edge	of	the	placenta	is	located.
- ■ Detach	the	placenta	from	the	implantation	site	by	keeping	the	fingers	tightly	together	and	using	the edge	of	the	hand	to	gradually	make	a	space	between	the	placenta	and	the	uterine	wall.
- ■ Proceed	gradually	all	around	the	placental	bed	until	the	whole	placenta	is	detached	from	the	uterine wall.
- ■ Withdraw	the	right	hand	from	the	uterus	gradually,	bringing	the	placenta	with	it.
- ■ Explore	the	inside	of	the	uterine	cavity	to	ensure	all	placental	tissue	has	been	removed.
- ■ With	the	left	hand,	provide	counter-traction	to	the	fundus	through	the	abdomen	by	pushing	it	in	the opposite	direction	of	the	hand	that	is	being	withdrawn.	This	prevents	inversion	of	the	uterus.
- ■ Examine	the	uterine	surface	of	the	placenta	to	ensure	that	lobes	and	membranes	are	complete.	If any	placental	lobe	or	tissue	fragments	are	missing,	explore	again	the	uterine	cavity	to	remove	them.

<!-- image -->

if hours or days have passed since delivery, or if the placenta is retained due to constriction ring or closed cervix, it may not be possible to put the hand into the uterus. do not persist. refer urgently to hospital B17 .

<!-- image -->

if the placenta does not separate from the uterine surface by gentle sideways movement of the fingertips at the line of cleavage, suspect placenta accreta. do not persist in efforts to remove placenta. refer urgently to hospital B17 .

<!-- image -->

## After	manual	removal	of	the	placenta

- ■ Repeat	oxytocin	10-IU	IM/IV.
- ■ Massage	the	fundus	of	the	uterus	to	encourage	a	tonic	uterine	contraction.
- ■ Give	ampicillin	2	g	IV/IM B15 .
- ■ If	fever	&gt;38.5°C,	foul-smelling	lochia	or	history	of	rupture	of	membranes	for	18	or	more	hours,	also give	gentamicin	80	mg	IM B15 .
- ■ If	bleeding	stops:
- → give	fluids	slowly	for	at	least	1	hour	after	removal	of	placenta.
- ■ If	heavy	bleeding	continues:
- → give	ergometrine	0.2	 mg	IM
- → give	20	IU	oxytocin	in	each	litre	of	IV	fluids	and	infuse	rapidly
- → refer urgently to hospital B17

.

- ■ During	transportation,	feel	continuously	whether	uterus	is	well	contracted	(hard	and	round).	If	not, massage	and	repeat	oxytocin	10	IU	IM/IV.
- ■ Provide	bimanual	or	aortic	compression	if	severe	bleeding	before	and	during	transportation B10 .

<!-- image -->

## rEpair thE tEar and Empty BladdEr

## Repair	the	tear	or	episiotomy

- ■ Examine	the	tear	and	determine	the	degree:
- → The	tear	is	small	and	involved	only	vaginal	mucosa	and	connective	tissues	and	underlying muscles	(first	or	second	degree	tear).	If	the	tear	is	not	bleeding,	leave	the	wound	open.
- → The	tear	is	long	and	deep	through	the	perineum	and	involves	the	anal	sphincter	and	rectal	mucosa (third	and	fourth	degree	tear).	Cover	it	with	a	clean	pad	and refer the woman urgently to hospital B17 .
- ■ If	first	or	second	degree	tear	and	heavy	bleeding	persists	after	applying	pressure	over	the	wound:
- → Suture	the	tear	or	refer	for	suturing	if	no	one	is	available	with	suturing	skills.
- → Suture	the	tear	using	universal	precautions,	aseptic	technique	and	sterile	equipment.
- → Use	a	needle	holder	and	a	21	gauge,	4	cm,	curved	needle.
- → Use	absorbable	polyglycon	suture	material.
- → Make	sure	that	the	apex	of	the	tear	is	reached	before	you	begin	suturing.
- → Ensure	that	edges	of	the	tear	match	up	well.

do not suture	if	more	than	12	hours	since	delivery. refer woman to hospital.

## Empty	bladder

If	bladder	is	distended	and	the	woman	is	unable	to	pass	urine:

- ■ Encourage	the	woman	to	urinate.
- ■ If	she	is	unable	to	urinate,	catheterize	the	bladder:
- → Wash	hands
- → Clean	urethral	area	with	antiseptic
- → Put	on	clean	gloves
- → Spread	labia.	Clean	area	again
- → Insert	catheter	up	to	4	cm
- → Measure	urine	and	record	amount
- → Remove	catheter.

## Eclampsia and prE-Eclampsia (1)

## Give	magnesium	sulphate

If	severe	pre-eclampsia	and	eclampsia

## iV/im combined dose (loading dose)

- ■ Insert	IV	line	and	give	fluids	slowly	(normal	saline	or	Ringer's	lactate)	1	litre	in	6-8	hours	(3-ml/minute) B .
- ■ Give	4-g	of	magnesium	sulphate	(20	ml	of	20%	solution)	IV	slowly	over	20	minutes (woman	may	feel	warm	during	injection).

## and:

- ■ Give	10	g	of	magnesium	sulphate	IM:	give	5	g	(10	ml	of	50%	solution)	IM	deep	in	upper	outer quadrant	of	each	buttock	with	1	ml	of	2%	lignocaine	in	the	same	syringe.

## if unable to give iV, give im only (loading dose)

- ■ Give	10	g	of	magnesium	sulphate	IM:	give	5	g	(10	ml	of	50%	solution)	IM	deep	in	upper	outer quadrant	of	each	buttock	with	1	ml	of	2%	lignocaine	in	the	same	syringe.

## if convulsions recur

- ■ After	15	minutes,	give	an	additional	2	g	of	magnesium	sulphate	(10	ml	of	20%	solution)	IV over	20	minutes.	If	convulsions	still	continue,	give	diazepam B14 .

## if referral delayed for long, or the woman is in late labour, continue treatment:

- ■ Give	5	g	of	50%	magnesium	sulphate	solution	IM	with	1	ml	of	2%	lignocaine	every	4	hours	in alternate	buttocks	until	24	hours	after	birth	or	after	last	convulsion	(whichever	is	later).
- ■ Monitor	urine	output:	collect	urine	and	measure	the	quantity.
- ■ Before	giving	the	next	dose	of	magnesium	sulphate,	ensure:
- → knee	jerk	is	present
- → urine	output	&gt;100	ml/4	hrs
- → respiratory	rate	&gt;16/min.
- ■ do not give	the	next	dose	if	any	of	these	signs:
- → knee	jerk	absent
- → urine	output	&lt;100	ml/4	hrs
- → respiratory	rate	&lt;16/min.
- ■ Record	findings	and	drugs	given.

## Important	considerations	in	caring	for a	woman	with	eclampsia	or	pre-eclampsia

- ■ Do	not	leave	the	woman	on	her	own.
- → Help	her	into	the	left	side	position	and	protect	her	from	fall	and	injury
- → Place	padded	tongue	blades	between	her	teeth	to	prevent	a	tongue	bite,	and	secure	it	to	prevent aspiration	( do not attempt	this	during	a	convulsion).
- ■ Give	IV	20%	magnesium	sulphate	slowly	over	20	minutes.	Rapid	injection	can	cause	respiratory failure	or	death.
- → If	respiratory	depression	(breathing	less	than	16/minute)	occurs	after	magnesium	sulphate,	do not	give	any	more	magnesium	sulphate.	Give	the	antidote:	calcium	gluconate	1	g	IV	(10	ml	of 10%	solution)	over	10	minutes.
- ■ do not give	intravenous	fluids	rapidly.
- ■ do not give	intravenously	50%	magnesium	sulphate	without	dilluting	it	to	20%.
- ■ refer urgently to hospital unless	delivery	is	imminent.
- → If	delivery	imminent,	manage	as	in	Childbirth d1-d2 and	accompany	the	woman	during transport
- → Keep	her	in	the	left	side	position
- → If	a	convulsion	occurs	during	the	journey ,	give	magnesium	sulphate	and	protect	her	from	fall	and injury .

- ■ Explain	to	the	woman	that	she	can	become	pregnant	soon	after	the	abortion	-	as	soon	as	she	has sexual	intercourse	-	if	she	does	not	use	a	contraceptive:
- → Any	family	planning	method	can	be	used	immediately	after	an	uncomplicated	first	trimester abortion.
- → If	the	woman	has	an	infection	or	injury:	delay	IUD	insertion	or	female	sterilization	until	healed.	For information	on	options,	see	Methods	for	non-breastfeeding	women	on d27 .
- ■ Make	arrangements	for	her	to	see	a	family	planning	counsellor	as	soon	as	possible,	or	counsel	her directly.	(see	The	decision-making	tool	for	family	planning	clients	and	providers	for	information	on methods	and	on	the	counselling	process).
- ■ Counsel	on	safer	sex	including	use	of	condom	if	she	or	her	partner	are	at	risk	of	sexually	transmitted infection	(STI)	or	HIV g2 .

## Provide	information	and	support	after	abortion

A	woman	may	experience	different	emotions	after	an	abortion,	and	may	benefit	from	support:

- ■ Allow	the	woman	to	talk	about	her	worries,	feelings,	health	and	personal	situation.	Ask	if	she	has any	questions	or	concerns.
- ■ Facilitate	family	and	community	support,	if	she	is	interested	(depending	on	the	circumstances,	she may	not	wish	to	involve	others).
- → Speak	to	them	about	how	they	can	best	support	her,	by	sharing	or	reducing	her	workload,	helping out	with	children,	or	simply	being	available	to	listen.
- → Inform	them	that	post-abortion	complications	can	have	grave	consequences	for	the	woman's health.	Inform	them	of	the	danger	signs	and	the	importance	of	the	woman	returning	to	the	health worker	if	she	experiences	any.
- → Inform	them	about	the	importance	of	family	planning	if	another	pregnancy	is	not	desired.
- ■ If	the	woman	is	interested,	link	her	to	a	peer	support	group	or	other	women's	groups	or	community services	which	can	provide	her	with	additional	support.
- ■ If	the	woman	discloses	violence	or	you	see	unexplained	bruises	and	other	injuries	which	make	you suspect	she	may	be	suffering	abuse,	see h4 .
- ■ Counsel	on	safer	sex	including	use	of	condoms	if	she	or	her	partner	are	at	risk	for	STI	or	HIV

<!-- image -->

## If	bleeding	continues:

- ■ Assess	and	manage	as	in	Bleeding	in	early	pregnancy/post-abortion	care B18-B22 .
- → If	fever,	foul-smelling	vaginal	discharge,	or	abdominal	pain,	give	first	dose	of	appropriate	IV/IM antibiotics B15 .
- → Refer	woman	to	hospital.

<!-- image -->

.

## AntenAtAl cAre

- ■ Always	begin	with rapid assessment and management (rAM) B3-B7 .	If	the	woman	has	no emergency	or	priority	signs	and	has	come	for	antenatal	care,	use	this	section	for	further	care.
- ■ Next	use	the Pregnancy status and birth plan chart C2 	to	ask	the	woman	about	her	present pregnancy	status,	history	of	previous	pregancies,	and	check	her	for	general	danger	signs.	Decide	on an	appropriate	place	of	birth	for	the	woman	using	this	chart	and	prepare	the	birth	and	emergency plan.	The	birth	plan	should	be	reviewed	during	every	follow-up	visit.
- ■ Check	all	women	for	pre-eclampsia,	anaemia,	syphilis	and	HIV	status	according	to	the	charts c3-c6 .
- ■ In	cases	where	an	abnormal	sign	is	identified	(volunteered	or	observed),	use	the	charts respond to observed signs or volunteered problems c7-c11 to	classify	the	condition	and	identify	appropriate treatment(s).
- ■ Give preventive measures due c12 .
- ■ Develop	a birth and emergency plan c14-c15

.

- ■ Advise	and	counsel	on	nutrition c13 ,	family	planning c16 ,	labour	signs,	danger	signs c15 ,	routine and	follow-up	visits c17 using Information and counselling sheets M1-M19 .
- ■ Record	all	positive	findings,	birth	plan,	treatments	given	and	the	next	scheduled	visit	in	the	homebased	maternal	card/clinic	recording	form.
- ■ Assess	eligibility	of	ARV	for	HIV-positive	woman
- ■ If	the	woman	is	HIV	positive,	adolescent	or	has	special	needs,	see G1-G11 H1-H4 .

- ■ Blankets.
- ■ Buckets	of	clean	water	and	some	way	to	heat	this	water.
- ■ Soap.
- ■ Bowls:	2	for	washing	and	1	for	the	placenta.
- ■ Plastic	for	wrapping	the	placenta.

## Advise	on	labour	signs

Advise	to	go	to	the	facility	or	contact	the	skilled	birth	attendant	if	any	of	the	following	signs:

- ■ a	bloody	sticky	discharge.

## AdvIse And counsel on fAMIly PlAnnInG

## Counsel	on	the	importance	of	family	planning

- ■ If	appropriate,	ask	the	woman	if	she	would	like	her	partner	or	another	family	member	to	be	included in	the	counselling	session.
- ■ explain	that	after	birth,	if	she	has	sex	and	is	not	exclusively	breastfeeding,	she	can	become	pregnant as	soon	as	four	weeks	after	delivery.	Therefore	it	is	important	to	start	thinking	early	on	about	what family	planning	method	they	will	use.
- → Ask	about	plans	for	having	more	children.	If	she	(and	her	partner)	want	more	children,	advise	that waiting	at	least	2-3	years	between	pregnancies	is	healthier	for	the	mother	and	child.
- → Information	on	when	to	start	a	method	after	delivery	will	vary	depending	whether	a	woman	is breastfeeding	or	not.
- → Make	arrangements	for	the	woman	to	see	a	family	planning	counsellor,	or	counsel	her	directly (see	the	Decision-making	tool	for	family	planning	providers	and	clients	for	information	on methods	and	on	the	counselling	process).
- ■ Counsel	on	safer	sex	including	use	of	condoms	for	dual	protection	from	sexually	transmitted infections	(STI)	or	HIV	and	pregnancy.	Promote	especially	if	at	risk	for	STI	or	HIV G4 .
- ■ For	HIV-positive	women,	see G5 for	family	planning	considerations
- ■ Her	partner	can	decide	to	have	a	vasectomy	(male	sterilization)	at	any	time.

## Special	considerations	for

## family	planning	counselling	during	pregnancy

## counselling should be given during the third trimester of pregnancy.

- ■ If	the	woman	chooses	female	sterilization:
- → can	be	performed	immediately	postpartum	if	no	sign	of	infection (ideally	within	7	days,	or	delay	for	6	weeks).
- → plan	for	delivery	in	hospital	or	health	centre	where	they	are	trained	to	carry	out	the	procedure.
- → ensure	counselling	and	informed	consent	prior	to	labour	and	delivery.
- ■ If	the	woman	chooses	an	intrauterine	device	(IUD):

→

can	be	inserted	immediately	postpartum	if	no	sign	of	infection	(up	to	48	hours,	or	delay	4	weeks)

- → plan	for	delivery	in	hospital	or	health	centre	where	they	are	trained	to	insert	the	IUD.

## AdvIse on routIne And follow-uP vIsIts

encourage the woman to bring her partner or family member to at least 1 visit.

## Routine	antenatal	care	visits

| 1st visit   | Before 4 months   | Before 16 weeks   |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 6 months    | 24-28 weeks       | 2nd visit         |
| 8 months    | 30-32 weeks       | 3rd visit         |
| 9 months    | 36-38 weeks       | 4th visit         |

- ■ All	pregnant	women	should	have	4	routine	antenatal	visits.
- ■ First	antenatal	contact	should	be	as	early	in	pregnancy	as	possible.
- ■ During	the	last	visit,	inform	the	woman	to	return	if	she	does	not	deliver	within	2	weeks	after	the expected	date	of	delivery.
- ■ More	frequent	visits	or	different	schedules	may	be	required	according	to	national	malaria	or	HIV policies.
- ■ If	women	is	HIV-positive	ensure	a	visit	between	26-28	weeks.

## Follow-up	visits

| If the problem was:   | return in:                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Hypertension          | 1 week if >8 months pregnant |

## HoMe delIvery wItHout A skIlled AttendAnt

reinforce the importance of delivery with a skilled birth attendant

## Instruct	mother	and	family	on clean	and	safer	delivery	at	home

If	the	woman	has	chosen	to	deliver	at	home	without	a	skilled	attendant,	review	these	simple instructions	with	the	woman	and	family	members.

- ■ Give	them	a	disposable	delivery	kit	and	explain	how	to	use	it.

## tell her/them:

- ■ To	ensure	a	clean	delivery	surface	for	the	birth.
- ■ To	ensure	that	the	attendant	should	wash	her	hands	with	clean	water	and	soap	before/after touching	mother/baby.	She	should	also	keep	her	nails	clean.
- ■ To,	after	delivery,	place	the	baby	on	the	mother's	chest	with	skin-to-skin	contact	and	wipe	the	baby's eyes	using	a	clean	cloth	for	each	eye.
- ■ To	cover	the	mother	and	the	baby.
- ■ To	use	the	ties	and	razor	blade	from	the	disposable	delivery	kit	to	tie	and	cut	the	cord.	The	cord	is	cut when	it	stops	pulsating.
- ■ To	dry	the	baby	after	cutting	the	cord.	To	wipe	clean	but	not	bathe	the	baby	until	after	6	hours.
- ■ To	wait	for	the	placenta	to	deliver	on	its	own.
- ■ To	start	breastfeeding	when	the	baby	shows	signs	of	readiness,	within	the	first	hour	after	birth.
- ■ To	NoT	leave	the	mother	alone	for	the	first	24	hours.
- ■ To	keep	the	mother	and	baby	warm.	To	dress	or	wrap	the	baby,	including	the	baby's	head.
- ■ T o	dispose	of	the	placenta	in	a	correct,	safe	and	culturally	appropriate	manner	(burn	or	burry).

## Advise	to	avoid	harmful	practices

- ■ Always	begin	with rapid assessment and management (ram)  b3-b7
- ■ Next,	use	the	chart	on examine the woman in labour or with ruptured membranes d2-d3 to	assess	the	clinical	situation	and obstetrical	history,	and	decide	the	stage	of	labour.
- ■ If	an	abnormal	sign	is	identified,	use	the	charts	on respond to obstetrical problems on	admission d4-d5 .
- ■ Care	for	the	woman	according	to	the	stage	of	labour d8-d13 and respond	to	problems	during	labour	and	delivery	as	on d14-d18 .
- ■ Use give supportive care throughout labour  d6-d7 to	provide support	and	care	throughout	labour	and	delivery.
- ■ Record	findings	continually	on	labour	record	and	partograph n4-n6

- ■ Keep	mother	and	baby	in	labour	room	for	one	hour	after	delivery and	use	charts Care of the mother and newborn within first hour of delivery placenta on d19 .
- ■ Next	use Care of the mother after the first hour following delivery of placenta d20 to	provide	care	until	discharge.	Use chart	on d25 to	provide preventive measures and advise on postpartum care d26-d28 to	advise	on	care,	danger	signs,	when to	seek	routine	or	emergency	care,	and	family	planning.

## examine the woman in labour or with ruptured membranes

<!-- image -->

first do rapid assessment and management  b3-b7 . then use this chart to assess the woman's and fetal status and decide stage of labour.

## ASK,	CHECK	RECORD

## history of this labour:

- ■ When	did	contractions	begin?
- ■ How	frequent	are	contractions? How	strong?
- ■ Have	your	waters	broken?	If	yes, when?	Were	they	clear	or	green?
- ■ Have	you	had	any	bleeding? If	yes,	when?	How	much?
- ■ Is	the	baby	moving?
- ■ Do	you	have	any	concern?

## Check record, or if no record:

- ■ Ask	when	the	delivery	is	expected.
- ■ Determine	if	preterm (less	than	8	months	pregnant).
- ■ Review	the	birth	plan.

## if prior pregnancies:

- ■ Number	of	prior	pregnancies/ deliveries.
- ■ Any	prior	caesarean	section, forceps,	or	vacuum,	or	other complication	such	as	postpartum haemorhage?
- ■ Any	prior	third	degree	tear?

## Current pregnancy:

- ■ RPR	status

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

.

- ■ Hb	results

.

- ■ Tetanus	immunization	status f2 .
- ■ HIV	status

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

.

- ■ Infant	feeding	plan
- ■ Receiving	any	medicine.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

.

## LOOK	,	LISTEN,	FEEL

- ■ Observe	the	woman's	response	to contractions:
- → Is	she	coping	well	or	is	she distressed?
- → Is	she	pushing	or	grunting?
- ■ Check	abdomen	for:
- → caesarean	section	scar.
- → horizontal	ridge	across	lower abdomen	(if	present,	empty	bladder b12 and	observe	again).

<!-- image -->

Feel	abdomen	for:

- → contractions	frequency,	duration, any	continuous	contractions?
- → fetal	lie-longitudinal	or transverse?
- → fetal	presentation-head,	breech, other?
- → more	than	one	fetus?
- → fetal	movement.
- ■ Listen	to	the	fetal	heart	beat:
- → Count	number	of	beats	in	1	minute.
- → If	less	than	100	beats	per minute,	or	more	than	180,	turn woman	on	her	left	side	and	count again.
- ■ Measure	blood	pressure.
- ■ Measure	temperature.
- ■ Look	for	pallor.
- ■ Look	for	sunken	eyes,	dry	mouth.
- ■ Pinch	the	skin	of	the	forearm:	does it	go	back	quickly?

■

## deCide stage of labour

## ASK,	CHECK	RECORD LOOK,	LISTEN,	FEEL

- ■ Explain	to	the	woman	that you	will	give	her	a	vaginal examination	and	ask	for	her consent.
- ■ Look	at vulva	for:
- → bulging	perineum
- → any	visible	fetal	parts
- → vaginal	bleeding
- → leaking	amniotic	fluid;	if	yes,	is	it meconium	stained,	foul-smelling?
- → warts,	keloid	tissue	or	scars	that	may interfere	with	delivery.

## perform vaginal examination

- ■ do not shave	the	perineal	area.
- ■ Prepare:
- → clean	gloves
- → swabs,	pads.
- ■ Wash	hands	with	soap	before	and	after	each examination.
- ■ Wash	vulva	and	perineal	areas.
- ■ Put	on	gloves.
- ■ Position	the	woman	with	legs	flexed	and	apart.

do not perform	vaginal	examination	if	bleeding now	or	at	any	time	after	7	months	of	pregnancy.

- ■ Perform	gentle	vaginal	examination	(do	not	start during	a	contraction):
- → Determine	cervical	dilatation	in centimetres.
- → Feel	for	presenting	part.	Is	it	hard,	round and	smooth	(the	head)?	If	not,	identify	the presenting	part.
- → Feel	for	membranes	-	are	they	intact?
- Feel	for	cord	-	is	it	felt?	Is	it	pulsating?	If
- → so,	act	immediately	as	on d15 .

- ■ Ensure	10-IU	oxytocin	IM	is	given d11

.

- ■ Await	strong	uterine	contraction (2-3	minutes)	and	deliver	placenta by controlled cord traction :
- → Place	side	of	one	hand	(usually	left)	above	symphysis	pubis	with	palm	facing	towards	the mother's	umbilicus.	This	applies	counter	traction	to	the	uterus	during	controlled	cord	traction.	At the	same	time,	apply	steady,	sustained	controlled	cord	traction.
- → If	placenta	does	not	descend	during	30-40	seconds	of	controlled	cord	traction,	release	both	cord traction	and	counter	traction	on	the	abdomen	and	wait	until	the	uterus	is	well	contracted	again. Then	repeat	controlled	cord	traction	with	counter	traction.
- → As	the	placenta	is	coming	out,	catch	in	both	hands	to	prevent	tearing	of	the	membranes.
- → If	the	membranes	do	not	slip	out	spontaneously,	gently	twist	them	into	a	rope	and	move	them	up and	down	to	assist	separation	without	tearing	them.
- ■ Check	that	placenta	and	membranes	are	complete.

.

## MONITOR	BABY	EVERY	15	MINUTES:

- ■ Breathing:	listen	for	grunting,	look	for	chest	in-drawing	and	fast	breathing J2
- ■ Warmth:	check	to	see	if	feet	are	cold	to	touch

.

## TREAT	AND	ADVISE	IF	REqUIRED

- ■ If,	after	30	minutes	of	giving	oxytocin,	the	placenta	is	not	delivered	and	the	woman	is	NOT	bleeding: → Empty	bladder b12
- → Encourage	breastfeeding
- → Repeat	controlled	cord	traction.
- ■ If	woman	is	bleeding,	manage	as	on b5
- ■ If	placenta	is	not	delivered	in	another	30	minutes	(1	hour	after	delivery):
- → Remove	placenta	manually b11
- → Give	appropriate	IM/IV	antibiotic b15 .
- ■ If	in	1	hour	unable	to	remove	placenta:
- → Refer	the	woman	to	hospital b17
- → Insert	an	IV	line	and	give	fluids	with	20	IU	of	oxytocin	at	30	drops	per	minute during	transfer b9 .

## DELIVER	THE	PLACENTA

- ■ Check	that	uterus	is	well	contracted	and	there	is	no	heavy	bleeding.
- ■ Repeat	check	every	5	minutes.
- ■ Examine	perineum,	lower	vagina	and	vulva	for	tears.
- ■ Collect,	estimate	and	record	blood	loss	throughout	third	stage	and	immediately	afterwards.
- ■ Clean	the	woman	and	the	area	beneath	her.	Put	sanitary	pad	or	folded	clean	cloth	under	her buttocks	to	collect	blood.	Help	her	to	change	clothes	if	necessary.
- ■ Keep	the	mother	and	baby	in	delivery	room	for	a	minimum	of	one	hour	after	delivery	of	placenta.
- ■ Dispose	of	placenta	in	the	correct,	safe	and	culturally	appropriate	manner.

## TREAT	AND	ADVISE,	IF	REqUIRED

- ■ If	heavy	bleeding:
- → Massage	uterus	to	expel	clots	if	any,	until	it	is	hard b10
- → Give	oxytocin	10	IU	IM b10 .
- → Call	for	help.
- → Start	an	IV	line b9 ,	add	20	IU	of	oxytocin	to	IV	fluids	and	give	at	60	drops	per	minute
- → Empty	the	bladder b12 .
- ■ If	bleeding	persists	and	uterus	is	soft:
- → Continue	massaging	uterus	until	it	is	hard.
- → Apply	bimanual	or	aortic	compression b10

.

- → Continue	IV	fluids	with	20	IU	of	oxytocin	at	30	drops	per	minute.
- → refer woman urgently to hospital  b17 .
- ■ If	third	degree	tear	(involving	rectum	or	anus), refer urgently to hospital  b17

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

.

- ■ For	other	tears:	apply	pressure	over	the	tear	with	a	sterile	pad	or	gauze	and	put	legs	together. do not cross	ankles.
- ■ Check	after	5	minutes.	If	bleeding	persists,	repair	the	tear b12
- ■ If	blood	loss ≈ 250-ml,	but	bleeding	has	stopped:
- → Plan	to	keep	the	woman	in	the	facility	for	24	hours.
- → Monitor	intensively	(every	30	minutes)	for	4	hours:
- → BP ,	pulse
- → vaginal	bleeding
- → uterus,	to	make	sure	it	is	well	contracted.
- → Assist	the	woman	when	she	first	walks	after	resting	and	recovering.
- → If	not	possible	to	observe	at	the	facility, refer to hospital  b17
- ■ If	disposing	placenta:
- → Use	gloves	when	handling	placenta.
- → Put	placenta	into	a	bag	and	place	it	into	a	leak-proof	container.
- → Always	carry	placenta	in	a	leak-proof	container.
- → Incinerate	the	placenta	or	bury	it	at	least	10	m	away	from	a	water	source,	in	a	2	m	deep	pit.

| ■ Fetal head is delivered, but shoulders are stuck and cannot be delivered.                | ■ Call for additional help. ■ Prepare for newborn resuscitation. ■ Explain the problem to the woman and her companion. ■ Ask the woman to lie on her back while gripping her legs tightly flexed against her chest, with knees wide apart.Ask the companion or other helper to keep the legs in that position. ■ Perform an adequate episiotomy. ■ Ask an assistant to apply continuous pressure downwards, with the palm of the hand on the abdomen directly above the pubic area, while you maintain continuous downward traction on the fetal head.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ■ If the shoulders are still not delivered and surgical help is not available immediately. | ■ Remain calm and explain to the woman that you need her cooperation to try another position. ■ Assist her to adopt a kneeling on 'all fours' position and ask her companion to hold her steady - this simple change of position is sometimes sufficient to dislodge the impacted shoulder and achieve delivery. ■ Introduce the right hand into the vagina along the posterior curve of the sacrum. ■ Attempt to deliver the posterior shoulder or arm using pressure from the finger of the right hand to hook the posterior shoulder and arm downwards and forwards through the vagina. ■ Complete the rest of delivery as normal. ■ If not successful, refer urgently to hospital b17 . do not pull excessively on the head. |

| ■ Prepare for delivery      | ■ Prepare delivery room and equipment for birth of 2 or more babies. Include: → more warm cloths → two sets of cord ties and razor blades → resuscitation equipment for 2 babies. ■ Arrange for a helper to assist you with the births and care of the babies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ■ Second stage of labour    | ■ Deliver the first baby following the usual procedure. Resuscitate if necessary. Label her/him Twin 1. ■ Ask helper to attend to the first baby. ■ Palpate uterus immediately to determine the lie of the second baby. If transverse or oblique lie, gently turn the baby by abdominal manipulation to head or breech presentation. ■ Check the presentation by vaginal examination. Check the fetal heart rate. ■ Await the return of strong contractions and spontaneous rupture of the second bag of membranes, usually within 1 hour of birth of first baby, but may be longer. ■ Stay with the woman and continue monitoring her and the fetal heart rate intensively. ■ Remove wet cloths from underneath her. If feeling chilled, cover her. ■ When the membranes rupture, perform vaginal examination d3 to check for prolapsed cord. If present, see Prolapsed cord d15 . ■ When strong contractions restart, ask the mother to bear down when she feels ready. ■ Deliver the second baby. Resuscitate if necessary. Label her/him Twin 2. ■ After cutting the cord, ask the helper to attend to the second baby. ■ Palpate the uterus for a third baby. If a third baby is felt, proceed as described above. If no third baby is felt, go to third stage of labour. do not attempt to deliver the placenta until all the babies are born. do not give the mother oxytocin until after the birth of all babies. |
| ■ Third stage of labour     | ■ Give oxytocin 10 IU IM after making sure there is not another baby. ■ When the uterus is well contracted, deliver the placenta and membranes by controlled cord traction, applying traction to all cords together d12-d23 . ■ Before and after delivery of the placenta and membranes, observe closely for vaginal bleeding because this woman is at greater risk of postpartum haemorrhage. If bleeding, see b5 . ■ Examine the placenta and membranes for completeness.There may be one large placenta with 2 umbilical cords, or a separate placenta with an umbilical cord for each baby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ■ Immediate postpartum care | ■ Monitor intensively as risk of bleeding is increased. ■ Provide immediate Postpartum care d19-d20 . ■ In addition: → Keep mother in health centre for longer observation → Plan to measure haemoglobin postpartum if possible → Give special support for care and feeding of babies J11 and k4 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## advise on postpartum Care

## Advise	on	postpartum	care	and	hygiene

Advise	and	explain	to	the	woman:

- ■ To	always	have	someone	near	her	for	the	first	24	hours	to	respond	to	any	change	in	her	condition.
- ■ Not	to	insert	anything	into	the	vagina.
- ■ To	have	enough	rest	and	sleep.
- ■ The	importance	of	washing	to	prevent	infection	of	the	mother	and	her	baby:
- → wash	hands	before	handling	baby
- → wash	perineum	daily	and	after	faecal	excretion
- → change	perineal	pads	every	4	to	6	hours,	or	more	frequently	if	heavy	lochia
- → wash	used	pads	or	dispose	of	them	safely
- → wash	the	body	daily.
- ■ To	avoid	sexual	intercourse	until	the	perineal	wound	heals.

## Counsel	on	nutrition

- ■ Advise	the	woman	to	eat	a	greater	amount	and	variety	of	healthy	foods,	such	as	meat,	fish,	oils, nuts,	seeds,	cereals,	beans,	vegetables,	cheese,	milk,	to	help	her	feel	well	and	strong	(give	examples of	types	of	food	and	how	much	to	eat).
- ■ Reassure	the	mother	that	she	can	eat	any	normal	foods	-	these	will	not	harm	the	breastfeeding	baby.
- ■ Spend	more	time	on	nutrition	counselling	with	very	thin	women	and	adolescents.
- ■ Determine	if	there	are	important	taboos	about	foods	which	are	nutritionally	healthy. Advise	the	woman	against	these	taboos.
- ■ Talk	to	family	members	such	as	partner	and	mother-in-law,	to	encourage	them	to	help	ensure	the woman	eats	enough	and	avoids	hard	physical	work.

## Counsel	on	the	importance	of	family	planning

- ■ If	appropriate,	ask	the	woman	if	she	would	like	her	partner	or	another	family	member	to	be	included in	the	counselling	session.
- ■ Explain	that	after	birth,	if	she	has	sex	and	is	not	exclusively	breastfeeding,	she	can	become	pregnant as	soon	as	4	weeks	after	delivery.	Therefore	it	is	important	to	start	thinking	early	about	what	family planning	method	they	will	use.
- → Ask	about	plans	for	having	more	children.	If	she	(and	her	partner)	want	more	children,	advise	that waiting	at	least	2-3	years	between	pregnancies	is	healthier	for	the	mother	and	child.
- → Information	on	when	to	start	a	method	after	delivery	will	vary	depending	on	whether	a	woman	is breastfeeding	or	not.
- → Make	arrangements	for	the	woman	to	see	a	family	planning	counsellor,	or	counsel	her	directly (see	the Decision-making tool for family planning providers and clients for	information	on methods	and	on	the	counselling	process).
- ■ Councel	on	safer	sex	including	use	of	condoms	for	dual	protection	from	sexually	transmitted	infection	(STI)	or HIV	and	pregnancy .	Promote	their	use,	especially	if	at	risk	for	sexually	transmitted	infection	(STI)	or	HIV g2 .
- ■ For	HIV-positive	women,	see g4 for	family	planning	considerations
- ■ Her	partner	can	decide	to	have	a	vasectomy	(male	sterilization)	at	any	time.

## ProVIde key InformatIon on HIV

## What	is	HIV	(human	immunodeficiency	virus) and	how	is	HIV	transmitted?

- ■ HIV	is	a	virus	that	destroys	parts	of	the	body's	immune	system.	A	person	infected	with	HIV	may	not feel	sick	at	first,	but	slowly	the	body's	immune	system	is	destroyed.	The	person	becomes	ill	and unable	to	fight	infection.	Once	a	person	is	infected	with	HIV,	she	or	he	can	give	the	virus	to	others.
- ■ HIV	can	be	transmitted	through:
- → Exchange	of	HIV-infected	body	fluids	such	as	semen,	vaginal	fluid	or	blood	during	unprotected sexual	intercourse.
- → HIV-infected	blood	transfusions	or	contaminated	needles.
- → From	an	infected	mother	to	her	child	(MTCT)	during:
- → pregnancy
- → labour	and	delivery
- → postpartum	through	breastfeeding.
- ■ Almost	four	out	of	20	babies	born	to	HIV	positive	women	may	be	infected	without	any	intervention.
- ■ HIV	cannot	be	transmitted	through	hugging	or	mosquito	bites.
- ■ A	blood	test	is	done	to	find	out	if	the	person	is	infected	with	HIV.
- ■ All	pregnant	women	are	offered	this	test.	They	can	refuse	the	test.

## Advantage	of	knowing	the	HIV	status	in	pregnancy

## knowing the HIV status during pregnancy is important so that:

- ■ the	woman	knows	her	HIV	status
- ■ can	share	information	with	her	partner
- ■ encourage	her	partner	to	be	tested

## If the woman is HIV-positive she can:

- ■ get	appropriate	medical	care	to	treat	and/or	prevent	HIV-associated	illnesses.
- ■ reduce	the	risk	of	transmission	of	infection	to	the	baby:
- → by	taking	antiretroviral	drugs	in	pregnancy,	and	during	labour	 G6 ,	 G9
- → by	practicing	safer	infant	feeding	options	 G9
- → by	adapting	birth	and	emergency	plan	and	delivery	practices	 G4 .
- ■ protect	herself	and	her	sexual	partner(s)	from	infection	or	reinfection.
- ■ make	a	choice	about	future	pregnancies.

## If the woman is HIV- negative she can:

- ■ learn	how	to	remain	negative.

## Counsel	on	safer	sex	including	use	of	condoms

safer seX Is any seXual PractIce tHat reduces tHe rIsk of transmIttInG HIV and seXually transmItted InfectIons (stIs) from one Person to anotHer

## tHe Best ProtectIon Is oBtaIned By:

- ■ Correct	and	consistent	use	of	condoms	during	every	sexual	act.
- ■ Choosing	sexual	activities	that	do	not	allow	semen,	fluid	from	the	vagina,	or	blood	to	enter	the mouth,	anus	or	vagina	of	the	partner.
- ■ Reducing	the	number	of	partners.
- → If	the	woman	is	HIV-negative	explain	to	her	that	she	is	at	risk	of	HIV	infection	and	that	it	is important	to	remain	negative	during	pregnancy	and	breastfeeding.	The	risk	of	infecting	the	baby is	higher	if	the	mother	is	newly	infected.
- → If	the	woman	is	HIV-positive	explain	to	her	that	condom	use	during	every	sexual	act	during pregnancy	and	breast	feeding	will	protect	her	and	her	baby	from	sexually	transmitted	infections,	or reinfection	with	another	HIV	strain	and	will	prevent	the	transmission	of	HIV	infection	to	her	partner.
- → Make	sure	the	woman	knows	how	to	use	condoms	and	where	to	get	them.

## HIV	testing	and	Counselling	services

## explain about HIV testing:

- ■ HIV	test	is	used	to	determine	if	the	woman	is	infected	with	HIV.
- ■ It	includes	blood	testing	and	counselling	.
- ■ Result	is	available	on	the	same	day	or	at	the	next	visit.
- ■ The	test	is	offered	routinely	to	every	woman	at	every	pregnancy	to	help	protect	her	and	her	baby's health.	She	may	decline	the	test.

## If HIV testing is not available in your setting, inform the woman about:

- ■ Where	to	go.
- ■ How	the	test	is	performed.
- ■ How	confidentiality	is	maintained	(	see	below).
- ■ When	and	how	results	are	given.
- ■ When	she	should	come	back	to	the	clinic	with	the	test	result
- ■ Costs	involved.
- ■ Provide	the	address	of	HIV	testing	in	your	area's	nearest	site	:
- ■ Ask	her	if	she	has	any	questions	or	concerns.

## Discuss	confidentiality	of	HIV	infection

- ■ Assure	the	woman	that	her	test	result	is	confidential	and	will	be	shared	only	with	herself	and	any person	chosen	by	her.
- ■ Ensure	confidentiality	when	discussing	HIV	results,	status,	treatment	and	care	related	to	HIV, opportunistic	infections,	additional	visits	and	infant	feeding	options	 A2 .
- ■ Ensure	all	records	are	confidential	and	kept	locked	away	and	only	health	care	workers	taking	care	of her	have	access	to	the	records.
- ■ do not label	records	as	HIV-positive.

## Counsel	on	implications	of	the	HIV	test	result

- ■ Discuss	the	HIV	results	when	the	woman	is	alone	or	with	the	person	of	her	choice.
- ■ State	test	results	in	a	neutral	tone.
- ■ Give	the	woman	time	to	express	any	emotions.

## If test result Is neGatIVe:

- ■ Explain	to	the	woman	that	a	negative	result	can	mean	either	that	she	is	not	infected	with	HIV	or	that she	is	infected	with	HIV	but	has	not	yet	made	antibodies	against	the	virus	(this	is	sometimes	called the	'window'	period).
- ■ Counsel	on	the	importance	of	staying	negative	by	safer	sex	including	use	of	condoms	 G2 .

<!-- image -->

## If test result Is PosItIVe:

- ■ Explain	to	the	woman	that	a	positive	test	result	means	that	she	is	carrying	the	infection	and	has	the possibility	of	transmitting	the	infection	to	her	unborn	child	without	any	intervention.
- ■ Let	her	talk	about	her	feelings.	Respond	to	her	immediate	concerns.
- ■ Inform	her	that	she	will	need	further	assessment	to	determine	the	severity	of	the	infection, appropriate	care	and	treatment	needed	for	herself	and	her	baby.	Treatment	will	slow	down	the progression	of	her	HIV	infection	and	will	reduce	the	risk	of	infection	to	the	baby.
- ■ Provide	information	on	how	to	prevent	HIV	re-infection.
- ■ Inform	her	that	support	and	counselling	is	available	if	needed,	to	cope	on	living	with	HIV	infection.
- ■ Discuss	disclosure	and	partner	testing.
- ■ Ask	the	woman	if	she	has	any	concerns.

## Benefits	of	disclosure	(involving)	and	testing	the	male partner(s)

Encourage	the	women	to	disclose	the	HIV	results	to	her	partner	or	another	person	she	trusts.	By disclosing	her	HIV	status	to	her	partner	and	family,	the	woman	may	be	in	a	better	position	to:

- ■ Encourage	partner	to	be	tested	for	HIV.
- ■ Prevent	the	transmission	of	HIV	to	her	partner(s).
- ■ Prevent	transmission	of	HIV	to	her	baby.
- ■ Protect	herself	from	HIV	reinfection.
- ■ Access	HIV	treatment,	care	and	support	services.
- ■ Receive	support	from	her	partner(s)	and	family	when	accessing	antenatal	care	and	HIV	treatment, care	and	support	services.

<!-- image -->

- ■ Use	the	advice	and	counselling	sections	on	C15 	during	antenatal	care	and	D27 	 during	postpartum visits.	The	following	advice	should	be	highlighted:
- → Explain	to	the	woman	that	future	pregnancies	can	have	significant	health	risks	for	her	and her	baby.	These	include:	transmission	of	HIV	to	the	baby	(during	pregnancy,	delivery	or breastfeeding),	miscarriage,	preterm	labour,	stillbirth,	low	birth	weight,	ectopic	pregnancy	and other	complications.
- → If	she	wants	more	children,	advise	her	that	waiting	at	least	2-3	years	between	pregnancies	is healthier	for	her	and	the	baby.
- → Discuss	her	options	for	preventing	both	pregnancy	and	infection	with	other	sexually	transmitted infections	or	HIV	reinfection.
- ■ Condoms	may	be	the	best	option	for	the	woman	with	HIV.	Counsel	the	woman	on	safer	sex	including the	use	of	condoms	 G2 .
- ■ If	the	woman	think	that	her	partner	will	not	use	condoms,	she	may	wish	to	use	an	additional method	for	pregnancy	protection.	However,	not	all	methods	are	appropriate	for	the	HIV-positive woman:
- → Given	the	woman's	HIV	status,	she	may	not	choose	to	breastfeed	and	lactational	amenorrhoea method	(LAM)	may	not	be	a	suitable	method.
- → Spermicides	are	not	recommended	for	HIV-positive	women.
- → Intrauterine	device	(IUD)	use	is	not	recommended	for	women	with	AIDS	who	are	not	on	ARV therapy.
- → Due	to	changes	in	the	menstrual	cycle	and	elevated	temperatures	fertility	awareness	methods may	be	difficult	if	the	woman	has	AIDS	or	is	on	treatment	for	HIV	infections.
- → If	the	woman	is	taking	pills	for	tuberculosis	(rifampin),	she	usually	cannot	use	contraceptive	pills, monthly	injectables	or	implants.

- → If	she	is	in	early	stage	of	HIV	infection,	she	will	need	to	take	medicines	during	pregnancy, childbirth	and	only	for	a	short	period	after	delivery	to	prevent	mother-to-child	transmission	of	HIV infection	(PMTCT).	Progress	of	disease	will	be	monitored	to	determine	if	she	needs	additional treatment.
- → If	she	has	mild-severe	HIV	disease	she	will	need	to	continue	the	treatment	even	after	childbirth and	postpartum	period.
- ■ She	may	have	some	side	effects	but		not	all	women	have	them.	Common	side	effects	like	nausea, diarrohea,	headache	or	fever	often	occur	in	the	beginning	but	they	usually	disappear	within	2-3 weeks.	Other	side	effects	like	yellow	eyes,	pallor,	severe	abdominal	pain,	shortness	of	breath,	skin rash,	painful	feet,	legs	or	hands	may	appear	at	any	time.	If	these	signs	persist,	she	should	come	to the	clinic.
- ■ Give	her	enough	ARV	tablets	for	2	weeks	or	till	her	next	ANC	visit.
- ■ Ask	the	woman	if	she	has	any	concerns.	Discuss	any	incorrect	perceptions.

## Support	adherence	to	ARV

## For	ARV	medicine	to	be	effective:

- ■ Advise	woman	on:
- → which	tablets	she	needs	to	take	during	pregnancy,	when	labour	begins	(painful	abdominal contractions	and/or	membranes	rupture)	and	after	childbirth.
- → taking	the	medicine	regularly,	every	day,	at	the	right	time.	If	she	chooses	to	stop	taking	medicines during	pregnancy,	her	HIV	disease	could	get	worse	and	she	may	pass	the	infection	to	her	child.
- → if	she	forgets	to	take	a	dose,	she	should	not	double	the	next	dose.
- → continue	the	treatment	during	and	after	the	childbirth	(if	prescribed),	even	if	she	is	breastfeeding.
- → taking	the	medicine(s)	with	meals	in	order	to	minimize	side	effects.
- ■ For	newborn:
- → Give	the	first	dose	of	medicine	to	the	newborn	8-12	hours	after	birth.
- → Teach	the	mother	how	to	give	treatment	to	the	newborn.
- → Tell	the	mother	that	the	baby	must	complete	the	full	course	of	treatment	and	will	need	regular visits	throughout	the	infancy.
- → If	the	mother	received	less	than	4	weeks	of	Zidovudine	(AZT)	during	pregnancy,	give	the	treatment to	the	newborn	for	4	weeks.
- ■ Record	all	treatment	given.	If	the	mother	or	baby	is	referred,	write	the	treatment	given	and	the regimen	prescribed	on	the	referral	card.
- ■ do not label	records	as	HIV-Positive
- ■ do not share	drugs	with	family	or	friends.

## counsel on Infant feedInG oPtIons

## Explain	the	risks	of	HIV	transmission	through breastfeeding	and	not	breastfeeding

- ■ Four	out	of	20	babies	born	to	known	HIV-positive	mothers	will	be	infected	during	pregnancy	and delivery	without	ARV	medication.	Three	more	may	be	infected	by	breastfeeding.
- ■ The	risk	may	be	reduced	if	the	baby	is	breastfed	exclusively	using	good	technique,	so	that	the breasts	stay	healthy.
- ■ Mastitis	and	nipple	fissures	increase	the	risk	that	the	baby	will	be	infected.
- ■ The	risk	of	not	breastfeeding	may	be	much	higher	because	replacement	feeding	carries	risks	too:
- → diarrhoea	because	of	contamination	from	unclean	water,	unclean	utensils	or	because	the	milk	is left	out	too	long.
- → malnutrition	because	of	insufficient	quantity	given	to	the	baby,	the	milk	is	too	watery,	or	because of	recurrent	episodes	of	diarrhoea.
- ■ Mixed	feeding	increases	the	risk	of	diarrhoea.	It	may	also	increase	the	risk	of	HIV	transmission.

## If	a	woman	does	not	know	her	HIV	status

- ■ Counsel	on	the	importance	of	exclusive	breastfeeding	 K2 .
- ■ Encourage	exclusive	breastfeeding.
- ■ Counsel	on	the	need	to	know	the	HIV	status	and	where	to	go	for	HIV	testing	and	counselling	 G3 .
- ■ Explain	to	her	the	risks	of	HIV	transmission:
- → even	in	areas	where	many	women	have	HIV,	most	women	are	negative
- → the	risk	of	infecting	the	baby	is	higher	if	the	mother	is	newly	infected
- → explain	that	it	is	very	important	to	avoid		infection	during	pregnancy	and	the	breastfeeding period.

## If	a	woman	knows	that	she	is	HIV-positive

- ■ Inform	her	about	the	options	for	feeding,	the	advantages	and	risks:
- → If	acceptable,	feasible,	safe	and	sustainable	(affordable),	she	might	choose	replacement	feeding with	home-prepared	formula	or	commercial	formula.
- → Exclusive	breastfeeding,	stopping	as	soon	as	replacement	feeding	is	possible.	If	replacement feeding	is	introduced	early,	she	must	stop	breastfeeding.
- → Exclusive	breastfeeding	for	6	months,	then	continued	breastfeeding	plus	complementary	feeding after	6	months	of	age,	as	recommended	for	HIV-negative	women	and	women	who	do	not	know their	status.
- ■ In	some	situations	additional	possibilities	are:
- → expressing	and	heat-treating	her	breast	milk
- → wet	nursing	by	an	HIV-negative	woman.
- ■ Help	her	to	assess	her	situation	and	decide	which	is	the	best	option	for	her,	and	support	her	choice.
- ■ If	the	mother	chooses	breastfeeding,	give	her	special	advice.
- ■ Make	sure	the	mother	understands	that	if	she	chooses	replacement	feeding	this	includes	enriched complementary	feeding	up	to	2	years.
- → If	this	cannot	be	ensured,	exclusive	breastfeeding,	stopping	early	when	replacement	feeding	is feasible,	is	an	alternative.
- → All	babies	receiving	replacement	feeding	need	regular	follow-up,	and	their	mothers	need	support to	provide	correct	replacement	feeding.

- ■ If	a	woman	is	an	adolescent	or	living	with	violence,	she	needs special	consideration.	During	interaction	with	such	women,	use this	section	to	support	them.

## emotional support for the Woman With special needs

You may need to refer many women to another level of care or to a support group. however, if such support is not available, or if the woman will not seek help, counsel her as follows. Your support and willingness to listen will help her to heal.

## Sources	of	support

a key role of the health worker includes linking the health services with the community and other support services available. maintain existing links and, when possible, explore needs and alternatives for support through the following:

- ■ Community	groups,	women's	groups,	leaders.
- ■ Peer	support	groups.
- ■ Other	health	service	providers.
- ■ Community	counsellors.
- ■ Traditional	providers.

## Emotional	support

Principles	of	good	care,	including	suggestions	on	communication	with	the	woman	and	her	family,	are provided	on a .	 When	giving	emotional	support	to	the	woman	with	special	needs	it	is	particularly important	to	remember	the	following:

- ■ Create	a	comfortable	environment:
- → Be	aware	of	your	attitude
- → Be	open	and	approachable
- → Use	a	gentle,	reassuring	tone	of	voice.
- ■ Guarantee	confidentiality	and	privacy:
- → Communicate	clearly	about	confidentiality.	Tell	the	woman	that	you	will	not	tell	anyone	else	about the	visit,	discussion	or	plan.
- → If	brought	by	a	partner,	parent	or	other	family	member,	make	sure	you	have	time	and	space	to talk	privately.	Ask	the	woman	if	she	would	like	to	include	her	family	members	in	the	examination and	discussion.	Make	sure	you	seek	her	consent	first.
- → Make	sure	the	physical	area	allows	privacy.
- ■ Convey	respect:
- → Do	not	be	judgmental
- → Be	understanding	of	her	situation
- → Overcome	your	own	discomfort	with	her	situation.
- ■ Give	simple,	direct	answers	in	clear	language:
- → V erify	that	she	understands	the	most	important	points.
- ■ Provide	information	according	to	her	situation	which	she	can	use	to	make	decisions.
- ■ Be	a	good	listener:
- → Be	patient.	Women	with	special	needs	may	need	time	to	tell	you	their	problem	or	make	a decision
- → Pay	attention	to	her	as	she	speaks.
- ■ Follow-up	visits	may	be	necessary.

## special considerations in managing the pregnant adolescent

special training is required to work with adolescent girls and this guide does not substitute for special training. however, when working with an adolescent, whether married or unmarried, it is particularly important to remember the following.

## When	interacting	with	the	adolescent

- ■ Do	not	be	judgemental.	You	should	be	aware	of,	and	overcome,	your	own	discomfort	with	adolescent sexuality.
- ■ Encourage	the	girl	to	ask	questions	and	tell	her	that	all	topics	can	be	discussed.
- ■ Use	simple	and	clear	language.
- ■ Repeat	guarantee	of	confidentiality a g .
- ■ Understand	adolescent	difficulties	in	communicating	about	topics	related	to	sexuality	(fears	of parental	discovery,	adult	disapproval,	social	stigma,	etc).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Support	her	when	discussing	her	situation	and	ask	if	she	has	any	particular	concerns:

- ■ Does	she	live	with	her	parents,	can	she	confide	in	them?	Does	she	live	as	a	couple?	Is	she	in	a	longterm	relationship?	Has	she	been	subject	to	violence	or	coercion?
- ■ Determine	who	knows	about	this	pregnancy	-	she	may	not	have	revealed	it	openly.
- ■ Support	her	concerns	related	to	puberty,	social	acceptance,	peer	pressure,	forming	relationships, social	stigmas	and	violence.

## Help	the	girl	consider	her	options	and	to	make decisions	which	best	suit	her	needs.

- ■ Birth	planning:	delivery	in	a	hospital	or	health	centre	is	highly	recommended.	She	needs	to understand	why	this	is	important,	she	needs	to	decide	if	she	will	do	it	and	and	how	she	will	arrange	it.
- ■ Prevention	of	STI	or	HIV/AIDS	is	important	for	her	and	her	baby.	If	she	or	her	partner	are	at	risk	of STI	or	HIV/AIDS,	they	should	use	a	condom	in	all	sexual	relations.	She	may	need	advice	on	how	to discuss	condom	use	with	her	partner.
- ■ Spacing	of	the	next	pregnancy	-	for	both	the	woman	and	baby's	health,	it	is	recommended	that	any next	pregnancy	be	spaced	by	at	least	2	or	3	years.	The	girl,	with	her	partner	if	applicable,	needs	to decide	if	and	when	a	second	pregnancy	is	desired,	based	on	their	plans.	Healthy	adolescents	can safely	use	any	contraceptive	method.	The	girl	needs	support	in	knowing	her	options	and	in	deciding which	is	best	for	her.	Be	active	in	providing	family	planning	counselling	and	advice.

## special considerations for supporting the Woman living With violence

violence against women by their intimate partners affects women's physical and mental health, including their reproductive health. While you may not have been trained to deal with this problem, women may disclose violence to you or you may see unexplained bruises and other injuries which make you suspect she may be suffering abuse. the following are some recommendations on how to respond and support her.

## Support	the	woman	living	with	violence

- ■ Provide	a	space	where	the	woman	can	speak	to	you	in	privacy	where	her	partner	or	others	cannot hear.		Do	all	you	can	to	guarantee	confidentiality,	and	reassure	her	of	this.
- ■ Gently	encourage	her	to	tell	you	what	is	happening	to	her.	You	may	ask	indirect	questions	to	help	her tell	her	story.
- ■ Listen	to	her	in	a	sympathetic	manner.	Listening	can	often	be	of	great	support.		Do	not	blame	her	or make	a	joke	of	the	situation.	She	may	defend	her	partner's	action.		Reassure	her	that	she	does	not deserve	to	be	abused	in	any	way.
- ■ Help	her	to	assess	her	present	situation.		If	she	thinks	she	or	her	children	are	in	danger,	explore together	the	options	to	ensure	her	immediate	safety	(e.g.	can	she	stay	with	her	parents	or	friends? Does	she	have,	or	could	she	borrow,	money?)
- ■ Explore	her	options	with	her.		Help	her	identify	local	sources	of	support,	either	within	her	family, friends,	and	local	community	or	through	NGOs,	shelters	or	social	services,	if	available.		Remind	her that	she	has	legal	recourse,	if	relevant.
- ■ Offer	her	an	opportunity	to	see	you	again.	Violence	by	partners	is	complex,	and	she	may	be	unable	to resolve	her	situation	quickly.
- ■ Document	any	forms	of	abuse	identified	or	concerns	you	may	have	in	the	file.

## Support	the	health	service	response	to	needs	of	women living	with	violence

- ■ Help	raise	awareness	among	health	care	staff	about	violence	against	women	and	its	prevalence	in the	community	the	clinic	serves.
- ■ Find	out	what	if	training	is	available	to	improve	the	support	that	health	care	staff	can	provide	to those	women	who	may	need	it.
- ■ Display	posters,	leaflets	and	other	information	that	condemn	violence,	and	information	on	groups that	can	provide	support.
- ■ Make	contact	with	organizations	working	to	address	violence	in	your	area.		Identify	those	that	can provide	support	for	women	in	abusive	relationships.		If	specific	services	are	not	available,	contact other	groups	such	as	churches,	women's	groups,	elders,	or	other	local	groups	and	discuss	with	them support	they	can	provide	or	other	what	roles	they	can	play,	like	resolving	disputes.	Ensure	you	have a	list	of	these	resources	available.

## Community support for maternal and newborn health

<!-- image -->

- ■ Everyone	in	the	community	should	be	informed	and	involved	in	the	process	of	improving	the	health	of	their	community	members.	This	section provides	guidance	on	how	their	involvement	can	help	improve	the	health	of	women	and	newborns.
- ■ Different	groups	should	be	asked	to	give	feedback	and	suggestions	on	how	to	improve	the	services	the	health	facilities	provide.
- ■ Use	the	following	suggestions	when	working	with	families	and	communities	to	support	the	care	of	women	and	newborns	during	pregnancy, delivery,	post-abortion	and	postpartum	periods.

## establish links

## Coordinate	with	other	health	care	providers and	community	groups

- ■ Meet	with	others	in	the	community	to	discuss	and	agree	messages	related	to	pregnancy,	delivery, postpartum	and	post-abortion	care	of	women	and	newborns.
- ■ Work	together	with	leaders	and	community	groups	to	discuss	the	most	common	health	problems and	find	solutions.	Groups	to	contact	and	establish	relations	which	include:
- → other	health	care	providers
- → traditional	birth	attendants	and	healers
- → maternity	waiting	homes
- → adolescent	health	services
- → schools
- → nongovernmental	organizations
- → breastfeeding	support	groups
- → district	health	committees
- → women's	groups
- → agricultural	associations
- → neighbourhood	committees
- → youth	groups
- → church	groups.
- ■ Establish	links	with	peer	support	groups	and	referral	sites	for	women	with	special	needs,	including women	living	with	HIV,	adolescents	and	women	living	with	violence.		Have	available	the	names	and contact	information	for	these	groups	and	referral	sites,	and	encourage	the	woman	to	seek	their support.

## Establish	links	with	traditional birth	attendants	and	traditional	healers

- ■ Contact	traditional	birth	attendants	and	healers	who	are	working	in	the	health	facility's	catchment area.	Discuss	how	you	can	support	each	other.
- ■ Respect	their	knowledge,	experience	and	influence	in	the	community.
- ■ Share	with	them	the	information	you	have	and	listen	to	their	opinions	on	this.	Provide	copies	of health	education	materials	that	you	distribute	to	community	members	and	discuss	the	content	with them.	Have	them	explain	knowledge	that	they	share	with	the	community.	Together	you	can	create new	knowledge	which	is	more	locally	appropriate.
- ■ Review	how	together	you	can	provide	support	to	women,	families	and	groups	for	maternal	and newborn	health.
- ■ Involve	TBAs	and	healers	in	counselling	sessions in	which	advice	is	given	to	families	and	other community	members.	Include	TBAs	in	meetings	with	community	leaders	and	groups.
- ■ Discuss	the	recommendation	that	all	deliveries	should	be	performed	by	a	skilled	birth	attendant. When	not	possible	or	not	preferred	by	the	woman	and	her	family,	discuss	the	requirements	for	safer delivery	at	home,	postpartum	care,	and	when	to	seek	emergency	care.
- ■ Invite	TBAs	to	act	as	labour	companions	for	women	they	have	followed	during	pregnancy,	if	this	is the	woman's	wish.
- ■ Make	sure	TBAs	are	included	in	the	referral	system.
- ■ Clarify	how	and	when	to	refer,	and	provide	TBAs	with	feedback	on	women	they	have	referred.

## involve the Community in quality of serviCes

all in the community should be informed and involved in the process of improving the health of their members.  ask the different groups to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve the services the health facility provides.

- ■ Find	out	what	people	know	about	maternal	and	newborn	mortality	and	morbidity	in	their	locality. Share	data	you	may	have	and	reflect	together	on	why	these	deaths	and	illnesses	may	occur.	Discuss with	them	what	families	and	communities	can	do	to	prevent	these	deaths	and	illnesses.	Together prepare	an	action	plan,	defining	responsibilities.
- ■ Discuss	the	different	health	messages	that	you	provide.	Have	the	community	members	talk	about their	knowledge	in	relation	to	these	messages.	Together	determine	what	families	and	communities can	do	to	support	maternal	and	newborn	health.
- ■ Discuss	some	practical	ways	in	which	families	and	others	in	the	community	can	support	women during	pregnancy,	post-abortion,	delivery	and	postpartum	periods:
- → Recognition	of	and	rapid	response	to	emergency/danger	signs	during	pregnancy,	delivery	and postpartum	periods
- → Provision	of	food	and	care	for	children	and	other	family	members	when	the	woman	needs	to	be away	from	home	during	delivery,	or	when	she	needs	to	rest
- → Accompanying	the	woman	after	delivery
- → Support	for	payment	of	fees	and	supplies
- → Motivation	of	male	partners	to	help	with	the	workload,	accompany	the	woman	to	the	clinic,	allow her	to	rest	and	ensure	she	eats	properly.	Motivate	communication	between	males	and	their partners,	including	discussing	postpartum	family	planning	needs.
- ■ Support	the	community	in	preparing	an	action	plan	to	respond	to	emergencies.	Discuss	the	following with	them:
- → Emergency/danger	signs	-	knowing	when	to	seek	care
- → Importance	of	rapid	response	to	emergencies	to	reduce	mother	and	newborn	death,	disability	and illness
- → T ransport	options	available,	giving	examples	of	how	transport	can	be	organized
- → Reasons	for	delays	in	seeking	care	and	possible	difficulties,	including	heavy	rains
- → What	services	are	available	and	where
- → What	options	are	available

## additioNal care of a small baby (or twiN)

use this chart for additional care of a small baby: preterm, -2 months early or weighing 500g-&lt;2500g. refer to hospital a very small baby: &gt;2 months early, weighing &lt;500g

## CARE	AND	MONITORING

- ■ Plan	to	keep	the	small	baby	longer	before	discharging.
- ■ Allow	visits	to	the	mother	and	baby.
- ■ Give	special	support	for	breastfeeding	the	small	baby	(or	twins)	 K4 :
- → Encourage	the	mother	to	breastfeed	every	2-3	hours.
- → Assess	breastfeeding	daily:	attachment,	suckling,	duration	and	frequency	of	feeds,	and	baby satisfaction	with	the	feed	 J4 	 K6 .
- → If	alternative	feeding	method	is	used,	assess	the	total	daily	amount	of	milk	given.
- → Weigh	daily	and	assess	weight	gain	 K7 .
- ■ Ensure	additional	warmth	for	the	small	baby	 K9 :
- → Ensure	the	room	is	very	warm	(25º-28ºC).
- → Teach	the	mother	how	to	keep	the	small	baby	warm	in	skin-to-skin	contact
- → Provide	extra	blankets	for	mother	and	baby.
- ■ Ensure	hygiene	 K10 .
- ■ Assess	the	small	baby	daily:
- → Measure	temperature
- → Assess	breathing	(baby	must	be	quiet,	not	crying):	listen	for	grunting;	count	breaths	per	minute, repeat	the	count	if	&gt;60	or	&lt;30;	look	for	chest	in-drawing
- → Look	for	jaundice	(first	10	days	of	life):	first	24	hours	on	the	abdomen,	then	on	palms	and	soles.
- ■ Plan	to	discharge	when:
- → Breastfeeding	well
- → Gaining	weight	adequately	on	3	consecutive	days
- → Body	temperature	between	36.5º	and	37.5ºC	on	3	consecutive	days

## Counsel	on	importance	of	exclusive	breastfeeding during	pregnancy	and	after	birth

## include partner or other family memBers if possiBle

## explain to the mother that:

- ■ Breast	milk	contains	exactly	the	nutrients	a	baby	needs
- → is	easily	digested	and	efficiently	used	by	the	baby's	body
- → protects	a	baby	against	infection.
- ■ Babies	should	start	breastfeeding	within	1	hour	of	birth.	They	should	not	have	any	other	food	or drink	before	they	start	to	breastfeed.
- ■ Babies	should	be	exclusively	breastfed	for	the	first	6	months	of	life.
- ■ Breastfeeding
- → helps	baby's	development	and	mother/baby	attachment
- → can	help	delay	a	new	pregnancy	(see d27 for	breastfeeding	and	family	planning).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

For	counselling	if	mother	HIV-positive,	see

## Help	the	mother	to	initiate	breastfeeding within	1	hour,	when	baby	is	ready

- ■ After	birth,	let	the	baby	rest	comfortably	on	the	mother's	chest	in	skin-to-skin	contact.
- ■ Tell	the	mother	to	help	the	baby	to	her	breast	when	the	baby	seems	to	be	ready,	usually	within	the first	hour.	Signs	of	readiness	to	breastfeed	are:
- → baby	looking	around/moving
- → mouth	open
- → searching.
- ■ Check	that	position	and	attachment	are	correct	at	the	first	feed.	Offer	to	help	the	mother	at	any	time
- ■ Let	the	baby	release	the	breast	by	her/himself;	then	offer	the	second	breast.
- ■ If	the	baby	does	not	feed	in	1	hour,	examine	the	baby J2-J9 .	If	healthy,	leave	the	baby	with	the mother	to	try	later.	Assess	in	3	hours,	or	earlier	if	the	baby	is	small J4 .
- ■ If	the	mother	is	ill	and	unable	to	breastfeed,	help	her	to	express	breast	milk	and	feed	the	baby	by cup K6 .	On	day	1	express	in	a	spoon	and	feed	by	spoon.
- ■ If	mother	cannot	breastfeed	at	all,	use	one	of	the	following	options:
- → donated	heat-treated	breast	milk.
- → If	not	available,	then	commercial	infant	formula.
- → If	not	available,	then	home-made	formula	from	modified	animal	milk.

<!-- image -->

## Support	exclusive	breastfeeding

- ■ Keep	the	mother	and	baby	together	in	bed	or	within	easy	reach. do not separate	them.
- ■ Encourage	breastfeeding	on	demand,	day	and	night,	as	long	as	the	baby	wants.
- → A	baby	needs	to	feed	day	and	night,	8	or	more	times	in	24	hours	from	birth.	Only	on	the	first	day may	a	full-term	baby	sleep	many	hours	after	a	good	feed.
- → A	small	baby	should	be	encouraged	to	feed,	day	and	night,	at	least	8	times	in	24	hours	from birth.
- ■ Help	the	mother	whenever	she	wants,	and	especially	if	she	is	a	first	time	or	adolescent	mother.
- ■ Let	baby	release	the	breast,	then	offer	the	second	breast.
- ■ If	mother	must	be	absent,	let	her	express	breast	milk	and	let	somebody	else	feed	the	expressed breast	milk	to	the	baby	by	cup.
- do not force	the	baby	to	take	the	breast.
- do not interrupt	feed	before	baby	wants.
- do not give	any	other	feeds	or	water.
- do not use	artificial	teats	or	pacifiers.
- ■ Advise	the	mother	on	medication	and	breastfeeding
- → Most	drugs	given	to	the	mother	in	this	guide	are	safe	and	the	baby	can	be	breastfed.
- → If	mother	is	taking	cotrimoxazole	or	fansidar,	monitor	baby	for	jaundice.

## Teach	correct	positioning	and	attachment for	breastfeeding

- ■ Show	the	mother	how	to	hold	her	baby.	She	should:
- → make	sure	the	baby's	head	and	body	are	in	a	straight	line
- → make	sure	the	baby	is	facing	the	breast,	the	baby's	nose	is	opposite	her	nipple
- → hold	the	baby's	body	close	to	her	body
- → support	the	baby's	whole	body,	not	just	the	neck	and	shoulders
- ■ Show	the	mother	how	to	help	her	baby	to	attach.	She	should:
- → touch	her	baby's	lips	with	her	nipple
- → wait	until	her	baby's	mouth	is	opened	wide
- → move	her	baby	quickly	onto	her	breast,	aiming	the	infant's	lower	lip	well	below	the	nipple.
- ■ Look	for	signs	of	good	attachment:
- → more	of	areola	visible	above	the	baby's	mouth
- → mouth	wide	open
- → lower	lip	turned	outwards
- → baby's	chin	touching	breast
- ■ Look	for	signs	of	effective	suckling	(that	is,	slow,	deep	sucks,	sometimes	pausing).
- ■ If	the	attachment	or	suckling	is	not	good,	try	again.	Then	reassess.
- ■ If	breast	engorgement,	express	a	small	amount	of	breast	milk	before	starting	breastfeeding	to	soften nipple	area	so	that	it	is	easier	for	the	baby	to	attach.

## counsel on Breastfeeding

## Give	special	support	to	breastfeed the	small	baby	(preterm	and/or	low	birth	weight)

## counsel the mother:

- ■ Reassure	the	mother	that	she	can	breastfeed	her	small	baby	and	she	has	enough	milk.
- ■ Explain	that	her	milk	is	the	best	food	for	such	a	small	baby.	Feeding	for	her/him	is	even	more important	than	for	a	big	baby.
- ■ Explain	how	the	milk's	appearance	changes:	milk	in	the	first	days	is	thick	and	yellow,	then	it becomes	thinner	and	whiter.	Both	are	good	for	the	baby.
- ■ A	small	baby	does	not	feed	as	well	as	a	big	baby	in	the	first	days:
- → may	tire	easily	and	suck	weakly	at	first
- → may	suckle	for	shorter	periods	before	resting
- → may	fall	asleep	during	feeding
- → may	have	long	pauses	between	suckling	and	may	feed	longer
- → does	not	always	wake	up	for	feeds.
- ■ Explain	that	breastfeeding	will	become	easier	if	the	baby	suckles	and	stimulates	the	breast	her/ himself	and	when	the	baby	becomes	bigger.
- ■ Encourage	skin-to-skin	contact	since	it	makes	breastfeeding	easier.

## help the mother:

- ■ Initiate	breastfeeding	within	1	hour	of	birth.
- ■ Feed	the	baby	every	2-3	hours.	Wake	the	baby	for	feeding,	even	if	she/he	does	not	wake	up	alone, 2	hours	after	the	last	feed.
- ■ Always	start	the	feed	with	breastfeeding	before	offering	a	cup.	If	necessary,	improve	the	milk	flow (let	the	mother	express	a	little	breast	milk	before	attaching	the	baby	to	the	breast).
- ■ Keep	the	baby	longer	at	the	breast.	Allow	long	pauses	or	long,	slow	feed.	Do	not	interrupt	feed	if	the baby	is	still	trying.
- ■ If	the	baby	is	not	yet	suckling	well	and	long	enough,	do	whatever	works	better	in	your	setting:
- → Let	the	mother	express	breast	milk	into	baby's	mouth K5 .
- → Let	the	mother	express	breast	milk	and	feed	baby	by	cup K6 .	On	the	first	day	express	breast milk	into,	and	feed	colostrum	by	spoon.
- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	observe	swallowing	if	giving	expressed	breast	milk.
- ■ Weigh	the	baby	daily	(if	accurate	and	precise	scales	available),	record	and	assess	weight	gain

<!-- image -->

.

## Give	special	support	to	breastfeed	twins

## counsel the mother:

- ■ Reassure	the	mother	that	she	has	enough	breast	milk	for	two	babies.
- ■ Encourage	her	that	twins	may	take	longer	to	establish	breastfeeding	since	they	are	frequently	born preterm	and	with	low	birth	weight.

## help the mother:

- ■ Start	feeding	one	baby	at	a	time	until	breastfeeding	is	well	established.
- ■ Help	the	mother	find	the	best	method	to	feed	the	twins:
- → If	one	is	weaker,	encourage	her	to	make	sure	that	the	weaker	twin	gets	enough	milk.
- → If	necessary,	she	can	express	milk	for	her/him	and	feed	her/him	by	cup	after	initial	breastfeeding.
- → Daily	alternate	the	side	each	baby	is	offered.

## alternative feeding methods

## Express	breast	milk

- ■ The	mother	needs	clean	containers	to	collect	and	store	the	milk. A	wide	necked	jug,	jar,	bowl	or	cup	can	be	used.
- ■ Once	expressed,	the	milk	should	be	stored	with	a	well-fitting	lid	or	cover.
- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	express	breast	milk:
- → To	provide	milk	for	the	baby	when	she	is	away.	To	feed	the	baby	if	the	baby	is small	and	too	weak	to	suckle
- → To	relieve	engorgement	and	to	help	baby	to	attach
- → To	drain	the	breast	when	she	has	severe	mastitis	or	abscesses.
- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	express	her	milk	by	herself. do not do	it	for	her.
- ■ Teach	her	how	to:
- → Wash	her	hands	thoroughly.
- → Sit	or	stand	comfortably	and	hold	a	clean	container	underneath	her	breast.
- → Put	her	first	finger	and	thumb	on	either	side	of	the	areola,	behind	the	nipple.
- → Press	slightly	inwards	towards	the	breast	between	her	finger	and	thumb.
- → Express	one	side	until	the	milk	flow	slows.	Then	express	the	other	side.
- → Continue	alternating	sides	for	at	least	20-30	minutes.
- ■ If	milk	does	not	flow	well:
- → Apply	warm	compresses.
- → Have	someone	massage	her	back	and	neck	before	expressing.
- → Teach	the	mother	breast	and	nipple	massage.
- → Feed	the	baby	by	cup	immediately.	If	not,	store	expressed	milk	in	a	cool,	clean	and	safe	place.
- ■ If	necessary,	repeat	the	procedure	to	express	breast	milk	at	least	8	times	in	24	hours.	Express	as much	as	the	baby	would	take	or	more,	every	3	 hours.
- ■ When	not	breastfeeding	at	all,	express	just	a	little	to	relieve	pain
- ■ If	mother	is	very	ill,	help	her	to	express	or	do	it	for	her.

.

## Hand	express	breast	milk directly	into	the	baby's	mouth

- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	express	breast	milk.
- ■ Hold	the	baby	in	skin-to-skin	contact,	the	mouth	close	to	the	nipple.
- ■ Express	the	breast	until	some	drops	of	breast	milk	appear	on	the	nipple.
- ■ Wait	until	the	baby	is	alert	and	opens	mouth	and	eyes,	or	stimulate	the	baby	lightly	to	awaken	her/him.
- ■ Let	the	baby	smell	and	lick	the	nipple,	and	attempt	to	suck.
- ■ Let	some	breast	milk	fall	into	the	baby's	mouth.
- ■ Wait	until	the	baby	swallows	before	expressing	more	drops	of	breast	milk.
- ■ After	some	time,	when	the	baby	has	had	enough,	she/he	will	close	her/his	mouth	and take	no	more	breast	milk.
- ■ Ask	the	mother	to	repeat	this	process	every	1-2	hours	if	the	baby	is	very	small (or	every	2-3	hours	if	the	baby	is	not	very	small).
- ■ Be	flexible	at	each	feed,	but	make	sure	the	intake	is	adequate	by	checking	daily	weight	gain.

## alternative feeding methods

## Cup	feeding	expressed	breast	milk

- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	feed	the	baby	with	a	cup.	Do	not	feed	the	baby	yourself.	The	mother	should:
- ■ Measure	the	quantity	of	milk	in	the	cup
- ■ Hold	the	baby	sitting	semi-upright	on	her	lap
- ■ Hold	the	cup	of	milk	to	the	baby's	lips:
- → rest	cup	lightly	on	lower	lip
- → touch	edge	of	cup	to	outer	part	of	upper	lip
- → tip	cup	so	that	milk	just	reaches	the	baby's	lips
- → but	do	not	pour	the	milk	into	the	baby's	mouth.
- ■ Baby	becomes	alert,	opens	mouth	and	eyes,	and	starts	to	feed.
- ■ The	baby	will	suck	the	milk,	spilling	some.
- ■ Small	babies	will	start	to	take	milk	into	their	mouth	using	the	tongue.
- ■ Baby	swallows	the	milk.
- ■ Baby	finishes	feeding	when	mouth	closes	or	when	not	interested	in	taking	more.
- ■ If	the	baby	does	not	take	the	calculated	amount:
- → Feed	for	a	longer	time	or	feed	more	often
- → Teach	the	mother	to	measure	the	baby's	intake	over	24	hours,	not	just	at	each	feed.
- ■ If	mother	does	not	express	enough	milk	in	the	first	few	days,	or	if	the	mother	cannot	breastfeed	at all,	use	one	of	the	following	feeding	options:
- → donated	heat-treated	breast	milk
- → home-made	or	commercial	formula.
- ■ Feed	the	baby	by	cup	if	the	mother	is	not	available	to	do	so.
- ■ Baby	is	cup	feeding	well	if	required	amount	of	milk	is	swallowed,	spilling	little,	and	weight	gain	is maintained.

## Quantity	to	feed	by	cup

- ■ Start	with	80	ml/kg	body	weight	per	day	for	day	1.	Increase	total	volume	by	10-20	ml/kg	per	day, until	baby	takes	150	ml/kg/day.	See	table	below.
- ■ Divide	total	into	8	feeds.	Give	every	2-3	hours	to	a	small	size	or	ill	baby.
- ■ Check	the	baby's	24	hour	intake.	Size	of	individual	feeds	may	vary.
- ■ Continue	until	baby	takes	the	required	quantity.
- ■ Wash	the	cup	with	water	and	soap	after	each	feed.

## approximate quantity to feed By cup (in ml) every 2-3 hours from Birth (By weight)

| weight (kg)   | day 0     |  2      | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6     | 7     |
|---------------|-----------|------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| .5-.9               | 15ml 17ml | 19ml | 21ml | 23ml | 25ml  | 27ml  | 27+ml |
| 2.0-2.4       | 20ml 22ml | 25ml | 27ml | 30ml | 32ml  | 35ml  | 35+ml |
| 2.5+          | 25ml 28ml | 30ml | 35ml | 35ml | 40+ml | 45+ml | 50+ml |

## Signs	that	baby	is	receiving adequate	amount	of	milk

- ■ Baby	is	satisfied	with	the	feed.
- ■ Weight	loss	is	less	than	10%	in	the	first	week	of	life.
- ■ Baby	gains	at	least	160-g	in	the	following	weeks	or	a	minimum	300-g	in	the	first	month.
- ■ Baby	wets	every	day	as	frequently	as	baby	is	feeding.
- ■ Baby's	stool	is	changing	from	dark	to	light	brown	or	yellow	by	day	3.

## Weigh	baby	in	the	first	month	of	life

## weigh the BaBy

- ■ Monthly	if	birth	weight	normal	and	breastfeeding	well.	Every	2	weeks	if	replacement	feeding	or treatment	with	isoniazid.
- ■ When	the	baby	is	brought	for	examination	because	not	feeding	well,	or	ill.

## weigh the small BaBy

- ■ Every	day	until	3	consecutive	times	gaining	weight	(at	least	15-g/day).
- ■ Weekly	until	4-6	weeks	of	age	(reached	term).

## Assess	weight	gain

use this table for guidance when assessing weight gain in the first month of life

| age                                                 | acceptable weight loss/gain in the first month of life   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|  week                                                     | Loss up to 10%                                           |
| 2-4 weeks                                           | Gain at least 160 g per week (at least 15 g/day)         |
|  month                                                     | Gain at least 300 g in the first month                   |
| if weighing daily with a precise and accurate scale | if weighing daily with a precise and accurate scale      |
| first week                                          | No weight loss or total less than 10%                    |
| afterward                                           | daily gain in small babies at least 20 g                 |

## Scale	maintenance

Daily/weekly	weighing	requires	precise	and	accurate	scale	(10-g	increment):

- → Calibrate	it	daily	according	to	instructions.
- → Check	it	for	accuracy	according	to	instructions.

Simple	spring	scales	are	not	precise	enough	for	daily/weekly	weighing.

## other Breastfeeding support

## Give	special	support	to	the	mother who	is	not	yet	breastfeeding

## (mother or baby ill, or baby too small to suckle)

- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	express	breast	milk K5 .	Help	her	if	necessary.
- ■ Use	the	milk	to	feed	the	baby	by	cup.
- ■ If	mother	and	baby	are	separated,	help	the	mother	to	see	the	baby	or	inform	her	about	the	baby's condition	at	least	twice	daily.
- ■ If	the	baby	was	referred	to	another	institution,	ensure	the	baby	gets	the	mother's	expressed	breast milk	if	possible.
- ■ Encourage	the	mother	to	breastfeed	when	she	or	the	baby	recovers.

## If	the	baby	does	not	have	a	mother

- ■ Give	donated	heat	treated	breast	milk	or	home-based	or	commercial	formula	by	cup.
- ■ Teach	the	carer	how	to	prepare	milk	and	feed	the	baby K6 .
- ■ Follow	up	in	2	weeks;	weigh	and	assess	weight	gain.

<!-- image -->

## Advise	the	mother	who	is	not	breastfeeding at	all	on	how	to	relieve	engorgement

(Baby died or stillborn, mother chose replacement feeding)

- ■ Breasts	may	be	uncomfortable	for	a	while.
- ■ Avoid	stimulating	the	breasts.
- ■ Support	breasts	with	a	well-fitting	bra	or	cloth.	Do	not	bind	the	breasts	tightly	as	this	may	increase her	discomfort.
- ■ Apply	a	compress.	Warmth	is	comfortable	for	some	mothers,	others	prefer	a	cold	compress	to reduce	swelling.
- ■ Teach	the	mother	to	express	enough	milk	to	relieve	discomfort.	Expressing	can	be	done	a	few	times a	day	when	the	breasts	are	overfull.	It	does	not	need	to	be	done	if	the	mother	is	uncomfortable.	It will	be	less	than	her	baby	would	take	and	will	not	stimulate	increased	milk	production.
- ■ Relieve	pain.	An	analgesic	such	as	ibuprofen,	or	paracetamol	may	be	used.	Some	women	use	plant products	such	as	teas	made	from	herbs,	or	plants	such	as	raw	cabbage	leaves	placed	directly	on the	breast	to	reduce	pain	and	swelling.
- ■ Advise	to	seek	care	if	breasts	become	painful,	swollen,	red,	if	she	feels	ill	or	temperature	greater	than	38ºC.

## pharmacological treatments to reduce milk supply are not recommended.

The	above	methods	are	considered	more	effective	in	the	long	term.

## ensure warmth for the BaBy

## Keep	the	baby	warm

## at Birth and within the first hour(s)

- ■ Warm	delivery	room:	for	the	birth	of	the	baby	the	room	temperature	should	be	25-28ºC,	no	draught.

- ■ Advise	to	use	extra	clothes,	socks	and	a	cap,	blankets,	to	keep	the	baby	warm	or	when	the	baby	is not	with	the	mother.
- ■ Wash	or	bath	a	baby	in	a	very	warm	room,	in	warm	water.	After	bathing,	dry	immediately	and thoroughly.	Keep	the	baby	warm	after	the	bath.	Avoid	bathing	small	babies.
- ■ Check	frequently	if	feet	are	warm.	If	cold,	rewarm	the	baby	(see	below).
- ■ Seek	care	if	the	baby's	feet	remain	cold	after	rewarming.

## Rewarm	the	baby	skin-to-skin

- ■ Before	rewarming,	remove	the	baby's	cold	clothing.
- ■ Place	the	newborn	skin-to-skin	on	the	mother's	chest	dressed	in	a	pre-warmed	shirt	open	at	the front,	a	nappy	(diaper),	hat	and	socks.
- ■ Cover	the	infant	on	the	mother's	chest	with	her	clothes	and	an	additional	(pre-warmed)	blanket.

## LABORATORY TESTS

## Check	urine	for	protein

- ■ Label	a	clean	container.
- ■ Give	woman	the	clean	container	and	explain	where	she	can	urinate.
- ■ Teach	woman	how	to	collect	a	clean-catch	urine	sample.		Ask	her	to:
- → Clean	vulva	with	water
- → Spread	labia	with	fingers
- → Urinate	freely	(urine	should	not	dribble	over	vulva;	this	will	ruin	sample)
- → Catch	the	middle	part	of	the	stream	of	urine	in	the	cup.		Remove	container	before	urine	stops.
- ■ Analyse	urine	for	protein	using	either	dipstick	or	boiling	method.

## DIPSTIck METhOD

- ■ Dip	coated	end	of	paper	dipstick	in	urine	sample.
- ■ Shake	off	excess	by	tapping	against	side	of	container.
- ■ Wait	specified	time	(see	dipstick	instructions).
- ■ Compare	with	colour	chart	on	label.		Colours	range	from	yellow	(negative)	through	yellow-green	and green-blue	for	positive.

## BOILING METhOD

- ■ Put	urine	in	test	tube	and	boil	top	half.		Boiled	part	may	become	cloudy.	After	boiling	allow	the	test tube	to	stand.	A	thick	precipitate	at	the	bottom	of	the	tube	indicates	protein.
- ■ Add	2-3	drops	of	2-3%	acetic	acid	after	boiling	the	urine	(even	if	urine	is	not	cloudy)
- → If	the	urine	remains	cloudy,	protein	is	present	in	the	urine.
- → If	cloudy	urine	becomes	clear,	protein	is	not	present.
- → If	boiled	urine	was	not	cloudy	to	begin	with,	but	becomes	cloudy	when	acetic	acid	is	added, protein	is	present.

## Check	haemoglobin

- ■ Draw	blood	with	syringe	and	needle	or	a	sterile	lancet.
- ■ Insert	below	instructions	for	method	used	locally.

## Perform	rapid	plasmareagin	(RPR)	test	for	syphilis

- ■ Seek	consent.
- ■ Explain	procedure.
- ■ Use	a	sterile	needle	and	syringe.	Draw	up	5	ml	blood	from	a	vein.	Put	in	a	clear	test	tube.
- ■ Let	test	tube	sit	20	minutes	to	allow	serum	to	separate	(or	centrifuge	3-5	minutes	at	20003000-rpm).	In	the	separated	sample,	serum	will	be	on	top.
- ■ Use	sampling	pipette	to	withdraw	some	of	the	serum. Take	care	not	to	include	any	red	blood	cells	from	the	lower	part	of	the	separated	sample.
- ■ Hold	the	pipette	vertically	over	a	test	card	circle.	Squeeze	teat	to	allow	one	drop	(50 -µl)	of	serum	to fall	onto	a	circle.		Spread	the	drop	to	fill	the	circle	using	a	toothpick	or	other	clean	spreader.

Important: Several samples may be tested on one card. Be careful not to contaminate the remaining test circles. Use a clean spreader for every sample. carefully label each sample with a patient's name or number.

- ■ Attach	dispensing	needle	to	a	syringe.	Shake	antigen.* Draw	up	enough	antigen	for	the	number	of	tests	to	be	done	(one	drop	per	test).
- ■ Holding	the	syringe	vertically,	allow	exactly	one	drop	of	antigen	(20 -µl)	to	fall	onto	each	test	sample. DO NOT stir.
- ■ Rotate	the	test	card	smoothly	on	the	palm	of	the	hand	for	8	minutes.** (Or	rotate	on	a	mechanical	rotator.)
* Make	sure	antigen	was	refrigerated	(not	frozen)	and	has	not	expired.
- **	Room	temperature	should	be	73º-85ºF	(22.8º-29.3ºC).

## Interpreting	results

- ■ After	8	minutes	rotation,	inspect	the	card	in	good	light.	Turn	or	lift	the	card	to	see	whether	there is	clumping	(reactive	result).	Most	test	cards	include	negative	and	positive	control	circles	for comparison.
1.   Non-reactive (no	clumping	or	only	slight	roughness)	-	Negative	for	syphilis
2. Reactive (highly	visible	clumping)	-	Positive	for	syphilis
3.    Weakly reactive (minimal	clumping)	-	Positive	for	syphilis

NOTE:	Weakly	reactive	can	also	be	more	finely	granulated	and	difficult	to	see	than	in	this	illsutration.

## PERfORM RAPID hIV TEST (TYPE Of TEST USE DEPENDS ON ThE NATIONAL POLIcY)

- ■ Explain	the	procedure	and	seek	consent	according	to	the	national	policy.
- ■ Use	test	kits	recommended	by	the	national	and/or	international	bodies	and	follow	the	instructions of	the	HIV	rapid	test	selected.
- ■ Prepare	your	worksheet,	label	the	test,	and	indicate	the	test	batch	number	and	expiry	date.	Check that	expiry	time	has	not	lapsed.
- ■ Wear	gloves	when	drawing	blood	and	follow	standard	safety	precautions	for	waste	disposal.
- ■ Inform	the	women	when	to	return	to	the	clinic	for		their	test	results	(same	day	or	they	will	have	to come	again).
- ■ Draw	blood	for	all	tests	at	the	same	time	(tests	for	Hb,	syphilis	and	HIV	can	often	be	coupled	at	the same	time).
- → Use	a	sterile	needle	and	syringe	when	drawing	blood	from	a	vein.
- → Use	a	lancet	when	doing	a	finger	prick.
- ■ Perform	the	test	following	manufacturer's	instructions.
- ■ Interpret	the	results	as	per	the	instructions	of	the	HIV	rapid	test	selected.
- → If	the	first	test	result	is	negative,	no	further	testing	is	done.	Record	the	result	as	-	Negative	for	HIV.
- → If	the	first	test	result	is	positive,	perform	a	second	HIV	rapid	test	using	a	different	test	kit.
- → If	the	second	test	is	also	positive,	record	the	result	as	-		Positive	for	HIV.
- → If	the	first	test	result	is	positive	and	second	test	result	is	negative,	record	the	result	as inconclusive.	Repeat	the	test	after	6	weeks	or	refer	the	woman	to	hospital	for	a	confirmatory	test.
- → Send	the	results	to	the	health	worker.	Respect	confidentiality A2 .
- ■ Record	all	results	in	the	logbook.

At	these	visits	your	baby	will	be	vaccinated. have your baby immunized .

## When	to	seek	care	for	danger	signs

Go	to	hospital	or	health	centre immediately, day or night, do not wait, if	your	baby	has	any	of	the following	signs:

- ■ Difficulty	breathing
- ■ Fits
- ■ Fever
- ■ Feels	cold
- ■ Bleeding
- ■ Stops	feeding
- ■ Diarrhoea.

Go	to	the	health	centre as soon as possible if	your	baby	has	any	of	the	following	signs:

- ■ Difficulty	feeding.
- ■ Feeds	less	than	every	5	hours.
- ■ Pus	coming	from	the	eyes.
- ■ Irritated	cord	with	pus	or	blood.
- ■ Yellow	eyes	or	skin.

## breastfeedIng

## Breastfeeding	has	many	advantages

## for the baby

- ■ During	the	first	6	months	of	life,	the	baby	needs	nothing	more	than	breast	milk	-	not	water,	not other	milk,	not	cereals,	not	teas,	not	juices.
- ■ Breast	milk	contains	exactly	the	water	and	nutrients	that	a	baby's	body	needs.	It	is	easily	digested and	efficiently	used	by	the	baby's	body.	It	helps	protect	against	infections	and	allergies	and	helps the	baby's	growth	and	development.

## for the mother

- ■ Postpartum	bleeding	can	be	reduced	due	to	uterine	contractions	caused	by	the	baby's	sucking.
- ■ Breastfeeding	can	help	delay	a	new	pregnancy.

for the fIrst  months of lIfe, gIve only breast mIlk to your baby, day and nIght as often and as long as she/he Wants.

## Suggestions	for	successful	breastfeeding

- ■ Immediately	after	birth,	keep	your	baby	in	the	bed	with	you,	or	within	easy	reach.
- ■ Start	breastfeeding	within	1	hour	of	birth.
- ■ The	baby's	suck	stimulates	your	milk	production.	The	more	the	baby	feeds,	the	more	milk	you	will produce.
- ■ At	each	feeding,	let	the	baby	feed	and	release	your	breast,	and	then	offer	your	second	breast.	At	the next	feeding,	alternate	and	begin	with	the	second	breast.
- ■ Give	your	baby	the	first	milk	(colostrum).	It	is	nutritious	and	has	antibodies	to	help	keep	your	baby healthy.
- ■ At	night,	let	your	baby	sleep	with	you,	within	easy	reach.
- ■ While	breastfeeding,	you	should	drink	plenty	of	clean,	safe	water.	You	should	eat	more	and	healthier foods	and	rest	when	you	can.

<!-- image -->

## The	health	worker	can	support	you	in starting	and	maintaining	breastfeeding

- ■ The	health	worker	can	help	you	to	correctly	position	the	baby	and	ensure	she/he	attaches	to	the breast.		This	will	reduce	breast	problems	for	the	mother.
- ■ The	health	worker	can	show	you	how	to	express	milk	from	your	breast	with	your	hands.		If	you	should need	to	leave	the	baby	with	another	caretaker	for	short	periods,	you	can	leave	your	milk	and	it	can be	given	to	the	baby	in	a	cup.
- ■ The	health	worker	can	put	you	in	contact	with	a	breastfeeding	support	group.

If you have any difficulties with breastfeeding, see the health worker immediately.

## Breastfeeding	and	family	planning

- ■ During	the	first	6	months	after	birth,	if	you	breastfeed	exclusively,	day	and	night,	and	your menstruation	has	not	returned,	you	are	protected	against	another	pregnancy.
- ■ If	you	do	not	meet	these	requirements,	or	if	you	wish	to	use	another	family	planning	method	while breastfeeding,	discuss	the	different	options	available	with	the	health	worker.
