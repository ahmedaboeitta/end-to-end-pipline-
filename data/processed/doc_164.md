## Important things to know in early pregnancy

This information will help you through your first 20 weeks of pregnancy. For more detailed information on health and wellbeing during pregnancy, visit our website: thewomens.org.au.

## Visiting your local doctor

While you wait for your appointment at the Women's, it's important to keep seeing your local doctor (GP) for care. They can help you with:

- organising tests like blood and urine tests, genetic tests and ultrasounds
- answering any questions or concerns you have about your pregnancy, health or family history
- talking through any mixed feelings you might have about being pregnant
- giving advice on diet and exercise
- checking if any medicines, vitamins, or supplements you take are safe in pregnancy, including natural and alternative medicines
- discussing how things are at home and at work
- supporting you with issues around alcohol, drugs, or quitting smoking
- shared maternity care.

## Shared maternity care

If you'd like pregnancy appointments close to your home or work, our shared maternity care may suit you. With this option, your baby is born at the Women's and you see one of our accredited shared care providers, like a GP, midwife, or obstetrician, for most of your care. You'll only need to visit the hospital a few times. You can discuss this option at your first appointment at the Women's.

## Genetic testing

You can have tests to check for genetic conditions, like Down syndrome. These can be arranged by your GP if you choose. It's best to do these tests in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy - some tests need to be done by 12 weeks.

## Ultrasound

We recommend an ultrasound at around 20 weeks to check your baby's development. You may also need an earlier scan as part of a Down syndrome test, or if you're unsure of your dates. Your GP can organise this for you.

## Pain or bleeding in early pregnancy

If you have pain or bleeding in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy, see your GP or go to your nearest hospital emergency department.

## Mixed feelings about being pregnant?

Talking with a pregnancy options counsellor may help. You can discuss your choices and get support to decide what is right for you.

Call 1800MyOptions on 1800 696 784 for information about pregnancy options counselling.

## Taking care of yourself in early pregnancy

To have a healthy pregnancy we recommend that you:

- avoid alcohol, drugs, smoking, and products containing retinol and vitamin A
- make sure all your medicines, vitamins, herbal preparations and alternative therapies are safe in pregnancy

- reduce caffeine to no more than 3 cups of coffee or tea per day
- eat more foods with folate, iodine and vitamin D.

## Common discomforts in early pregnancy

It's normal to have a few discomforts in early pregnancy, including:

- morning sickness (feeling sick or vomiting, which may last on and off all day)
- needing to wee more often
- back pain, leg cramps and feeling tired
- craving certain foods or avoiding others
- rashes and itchy skin
- constipation
- heartburn
- larger, more tender breasts.

## Depression

Everyone feels sad at times, but if you feel very unhappy most of the time, you may be depressed. If you feel this way, speak with your GP or midwife for help. Depression can be treated successfully.

## Violence has no place in pregnancy

Violence can harm you, your pregnancy, your baby, and other children. If you're experiencing violence, your midwife or GP can give you confidential support to help you safely plan your birth and look after your family.

## Your appointment at the Women's

We will send you a letter with the details of your pregnancy booking appointment. This appointment may be by video call, phone, or face to face. It will usually happen after you are 18 weeks pregnant.

We offer a variety of childbirth education programs. They fill very quickly, so please book online as soon as possible. Childbirth education is free if you have a Medicare card. To book or find out more about our programs, visit thewomens.org.au/wm-cbe.
