## Abstract

## Background

Historically,  the  National  Center  for  Health  Statistics (NCHS) has published estimated pregnancy rates in the United States, with the most recent estimates published for  2010.  Pregnancy  rates  are  calculated  from  three components: live births, pregnancy losses (miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and stillbirth),  and  induced  abortions.  Some  of  the  data sources  used  to  estimate  these  components  have limitations with respect to factors such as data timeliness and completeness. Alternative ways of accounting for  these  limitations  by  using  additional  data  sources and statistical methods for imputing missing data may improve the accuracy and timeliness of pregnancy rate estimates.

## Methods

This  report  describes  an  updated  methodology  to estimate  overall  and  unintended  pregnancy  rates  for the  United  States  during  2010-2019,  and  examines differences  by  demographic  factors.  Machine  learning models  were  used  to  impute  missing  information  on induced abortions, and data integration methods were used  to  combine  estimates  of  abortions,  live  births,

## Introduction

Historically, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has published estimated pregnancy rates in the United States, relying on data from several sources: counts of  live  births  from  the  National  Vital  Statistics  System (NVSS)-Natality, estimates of pregnancy loss (miscarriage or spontaneous  abortion,  ectopic  pregnancy,  and  stillbirth) from  the  National  Survey  of  Family  Growth  (NSFG),  and estimates of induced abortion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Abortion Surveillance System,  which  are  adjusted  to  national  totals  using  data from the Guttmacher Institute (a nonprofit organization) (1).

and pregnancy losses to produce estimates of the total numbers  of  pregnancies  occurring  during  2010-2019 and corresponding pregnancy rates, along with outcomes related to unintended pregnancy.

## Results

An estimated 6,069,000 pregnancies in 2010 in females aged  15-44  occurred  in  2010,  declining  by  9%  to 5,507,000 in 2019. The overall pregnancy rate (estimated number of pregnancies per 1,000 females aged 15-44) was  97.3  in  2010,  declining  by  12%  to  85.6  in  2019. The  percentage  of  pregnancies  that  were  unintended declined from 43.3% in 2010 to 41.6% in 2019.

## Conclusions

More  recent and timely estimates of overall and unintended  pregnancy  rates  can  help  inform  policies and programs to decrease the percentage of unintended pregnancies  and  are  crucial  for  tracking  reproductive health outcomes in the United States.

The most recent NCHS estimates of pregnancy rates for the United States are from 2010 (2,3).

More recent estimates of overall and unintended pregnancy rates can help inform policies and programs to decrease the percentage  of  unintended  pregnancies  and  are  crucial  for tracking reproductive health outcomes in the United States. Decreasing unintended pregnancy is a national health priority in the United States (Healthy People 2030 Objective FP-01) (4).  The  percentage  of  unintended  pregnancies  decreased from  51%  in  2008  to  45%  in  2011  (5).  While  unintended pregnancy had historically been declining, the most recent estimate published by NCHS (43% in 2013) remains above the Healthy People 2030 target of 36.5% (4).

## General Methodological Issues Related to Estimating Pregnancy Rates

This report describes an updated methodology to estimate overall and unintended pregnancy rates in the United States for  2010-2019,  and  examines  differences  by  demographic factors. Pregnancy rates are calculated from three components:  live  births,  pregnancy  losses,  and  induced abortions.  Figure  1  illustrates  the  three  components  of pregnancy rates and their respective data sources. The three components are outlined below along with corresponding methodological issues and data source quality concerns.

## Live births

NVSS-Natality data include information from birth certificates  registered  in  all  50  states,  New  York  City,  the District of Columbia (D.C.), and 5 U.S. territories. Over 99% of births occurring in the United States are registered, and birth certificate data are provided to NCHS through the Vital

Statistics Cooperative Program (6,7). Data are available at the state (or equivalent reporting area or jurisdiction) level and are  available  by  request  from  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nvss/nvss-restricted-data.htm or through CDC WONDER (8) by maternal characteristics collected on the birth certificate, including  maternal  age,  race  and  Hispanic  origin,  marital status, and parity.

Data  on  live  births  are  also  captured  in  NSFG,  and  these estimates  tend  to  be  comparable  to  the  numbers  of  live births from NVSS-Natality data (9,10). However, estimates of live births from NSFG do not include births to older women (either aged 45 and over or 50 and over, depending on the data year) and are subject to sampling error and variability.

## Pregnancy loss

Historically, in the calculations of pregnancy rates, estimates of  pregnancy  loss  (miscarriage  or  spontaneous  abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and stillbirth) were based on pregnancy history data from NSFG. NSFG is a nationally representative

NOTES: NSFG data are not used to estimate the total number of live births or induced abortions, but NSFG includes data on these outcomes. NSFG data on live births are used to estimate the ratio of pregnancy losses to live births.

household  survey  of  the  U.S.  household  population  aged 15-49  (aged  15-44  before  2015)  that  uses  a  complex, multistage probability design to select one participant per household  (10).  In  2022,  NSFG  began  including  an  online survey  mode  but  for  2019  and  earlier  years,  which  were used  in  calculations  being  described  here,  data  collection was conducted completely in person. As part of the survey questionnaire, female respondents provide detailed information about their current or past pregnancies, including how each pregnancy ended. To calculate the pregnancy loss component in previous reports, ratios of fetal losses divided by fetal losses plus live births were calculated by age and race and Hispanic-origin subgroup, combining data from several NSFG file releases to ensure stable estimates (1). The values were then multiplied by the number of live births in each year (and subgroup) for years most closely corresponding to NSFG's data years to provide as reasonable an estimate as possible of fetal losses that occurred annually for use in the calculation of annual pregnancies in the United States.

## Limitations of pregnancy loss data

Historically, NSFG data were used to estimate pregnancy loss as losses across all gestational ages are reported in the NSFG pregnancy  history  files,  though  the  number  of  stillbirths reported to occur at gestational ages of 20 weeks or more is typically very small and may be difficult to estimate reliably for each year. However, fetal death data are also available from the NVSS-Fetal Death files (11-14), which represent all fetal deaths registered in the 50 states, New York City, and D.C. Vital statistics fetal death data are generally limited to losses  occurring  at  gestational  ages  of  20  weeks  or  more, with the majority of states requiring the reporting of fetal deaths  of  20  weeks  of  gestation  or  more  (or  350  grams delivery  weight),  though  some  states  report  losses  at  all gestational ages (12-14).

Estimates from NSFG suggest that the risk of pregnancy loss increased  from  1990  to  2011  (15).  Consequently,  relying on a single ratio of pregnancy loss-to-live births estimated over a large time period may not be sufficient to accurately capture  the  number  of  pregnancy  losses  occurring  in  the United  States over time if substantial, differing trends over time  are  present.  Additionally,  the  timing  of  pregnancy awareness may have potentially changed over time as well, given  changes  in  the  ability  to  detect  pregnancies  earlier and  at  home  as  well  as  the  use  of  fertility  treatments. These changes have consequences for the awareness of  early  pregnancy  losses,  although  a  study  using  NSFG data  reported  no  significant  changes  in  mean  gestational age  at  the  time  of  pregnancy  awareness  for  pregnancies occurring from 1990-2012 (16). Pregnancy loss can potentially  be  estimated  by  integrating  data  from  NSFG and  NVSS-Fetal  Death  files,  which  may  provide  more accurate  or  complete  information  about  pregnancy  loss across  the  entire  spectrum  of  gestational  age  and  by maternal characteristics. Finally, while NSFG  estimates are  available  at  the  national  level,  NVSS-Fetal  Death  data (available  upon  request  from  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nvss/nvss-restricted-data.htm) are available at the state (or equivalent reporting area) level as well as the national level.

## Induced abortion

Previous  publications  of  pregnancy  rates  were  based  on induced  abortion  data  from  two  sources:  CDC  and  the Guttmacher  Institute.  CDC's  Abortion  Surveillance  System relies on the voluntary submission of aggregated data from the  central  health  agencies  of  reporting  areas  (states  and jurisdictions)  to  document  the  number  and  characteristics of  females  obtaining  legal  abortions  in  the  United  States (17).  Because  not  all  states  submit  abortion  data  to  CDC, data  from  the  Guttmacher  Institute's  Abortion  Provider Census, a periodic survey of all known U.S. facilities providing abortion  services  (18),  were  previously  used  to  benchmark the  numbers  provided  through  CDC's  Abortion  Surveillance System  to  a  national  total.  Although  estimates  of  induced abortion are also available in NSFG's pregnancy history data, these data have not been used to calculate pregnancy rates due  to  the  potential  underreporting  of  induced  abortion in  surveys  that  rely  on  interviews  or  self-report,  like  NSFG (10,19,20). For example, Desai et al. reported that likely only 40% of abortions were captured in NSFG from 2006-2015, and that 11% of pregnancies overall may be missed because pregnancies  ending  in  abortion  may  not  be  reported  (21). However,  all  data  sources  capturing  abortions  have  known limitations.

## Limitations of induced abortion data

Data from CDC's Abortion Surveillance System are limited in that not all states or reporting areas submit abortion data to the system. Out of the system's 52 reporting areas (the 50 states,  D.C.,  and  New  York  City)  48  consistently  submitted abortion  data  to  CDC  (excluding  California,  Maryland,  and New Hampshire in all  years,  and  D.C.  in  2016)  from  2006 through  2019  (17).  Additionally,  data  for  Wyoming  were suppressed  for  some  years  due  to  the  small  numbers reported  (fewer  than  20  abortions)  (22).  It  is  estimated that abortions performed  in  California,  Maryland,  and New  Hampshire  account  for  about  20%  of  all  abortions performed  in  the  United  States  (17,18,23).  Additionally, numbers reported by D.C. and New Jersey were substantially lower than estimates published by the Guttmacher Institute, suggesting  that  the  number  of  abortions  may  have  been underreported  in  those  reporting  areas  (17,18,23).  While most reporting areas that submit abortion data to CDC have laws  requiring  medical  providers  to  submit  data  for  every abortion that is performed to a central health agency, in New Jersey and D.C., providers voluntarily submitted data during most of the study period (24,25). Enforcement of required reporting also varies by reporting areas, leading to potential underreporting  in  other  areas.  Finally,  not  all  reporting areas provided numbers by various sociodemographic

characteristics  in  2019  (such  as  race  and  Hispanic  origin [reported by 30 reporting areas], marital status [42 areas], and parity [45 areas]). As a result, information on abortion by these demographic characteristics is incomplete in CDC's Abortion Surveillance System.

Data  from  the  Guttmacher  Institute's  Abortion  Provider Census  are  collected  via  a  mail-based  provider  survey. The  response  rates  to  the  2014  and  2017  mail-based surveys were 38%-42% (18,26). While extensive efforts are undertaken to follow up with providers by phone, only an additional 17%-20% of facilities provide abortion data after follow-up, for a total response rate of about 60%. Data for the  remaining  providers  and  facilities  are  collected  from health department data or were estimated using previously available  data  or  key  informants  (about  17%-20%  in  each category),  with  a  small  percentage  of  remaining  providers and facilities determined to be closed or no longer providing abortion  services.  A  recent  report  describing  these  data suggest that it is possible that not all abortion providers are captured, particularly those with small caseloads, potentially undercounting the total number of abortions performed by as much as 5% (18). However, it is also possible that the total numbers  of  abortions  are  overestimated,  as  the  extent  to which low response rates and nonresponse bias might affect estimated  numbers  of  abortions  performed  in  the  United States  is  unknown.  Providers  may  over-  or  underreport  the numbers of induced abortions performed, and there are no published studies documenting the validity of provider-based reports  for  abortions.  Other  studies  of  healthcare  provider surveys have suggested that low response rates and potential bias  are  often  of  concern  (27-30)  and  that  providers  may overestimate the number of procedures or services performed relative to chart audits or patient surveys (30-33). Additional limitations of the Guttmacher abortion data include the lack of information about sociodemographic characteristics of the females receiving services, including state of residence, and the lack of timely annual data.

Most of the discrepancies between CDC's Abortion Surveillance System data and Guttmacher Institute data are due to the lack of data for California, Maryland, and New Hampshire  in  CDC's  Abortion  Surveillance  System  (1,23). Therefore, it is possible that missing data from CDC's Abortion Surveillance System for these three states could be imputed, providing  a  more  comprehensive  picture  of  abortion  data across the United States by demographic factors and better accounting for potential uncertainty in these estimates.

This report describes an updated methodological approach to  estimate  pregnancy  rates  and  associated  uncertainty. The goal of this updated methodology is to better account for  some  of  the  limitations  of  the  various  input  data  and prior estimates, integrate more data sources in new ways, and  use  sensitivity  analyses  to  ascertain  the  impact  of varying the underlying assumptions about data quality and completeness.

## Methods

## Live births

Data on live births were from restricted-use NVSS-Natality data files for 2010-2019 to calculate numbers of births by state of residence, maternal age, race and Hispanic origin, and  parity.  While  data  on  live  births  are  also  captured  in NSFG's pregnancy history files for 2010-2019, estimates of live births from NSFG do not include births to older women (aged either 45 and over or 50 and over, depending on the data year) and are subject to sampling error and variability. Therefore, estimates of live births from NSFG are only used to estimate the ratio of pregnancy losses to live births and not as a second source of data on the total number of live births because complete data on live births is available from NVSS-Natality data.

## Pregnancy loss

Data on fetal deaths were from the NVSS-Fetal Death data files for 2010-2019. The numbers of fetal deaths (occurring at 20 weeks of gestation or more) were calculated by state of residence, maternal age, race and Hispanic origin, and parity. Data on pregnancy losses across all gestational ages (including miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and stillbirth) were obtained from pregnancy history data included in the NSFG pregnancy-based files for 2010-2019. Pregnancy losses in NSFG data were categorized as those occurring at 20 or more weeks of gestation (consistent with NVSS-Fetal Death data), or at less than 20 weeks of gestation. Gestational age detail (in weeks) is a restricted-use variable in NSFG data for 2017-2019 and is not included in the public-use files. Similar to live births, data on pregnancy losses in NSFG were used to estimate the ratio of losses to live births, and not as a second source of data on the total number of pregnancy losses due to  the  lack  of  coverage  among  older  women  and  potential sampling variability.

## Induced abortion

Data  on  induced  abortions  were  from  publicly  available estimates from CDC's Abortion Surveillance System. Numbers of induced abortions reported to CDC's surveillance system by  state  of  occurrence,  age,  race  and  Hispanic  origin,  and parity were obtained from published tables for 2010-2019 (17,22,23,34-39). Published tables on the counts by residence  versus  the  counts  by  occurrence  (40)  were  also used  to  develop  a  method  to  estimate  counts  by  state  of residence from the reported counts by state of occurrence.

## Population counts

Counts  of  the  female  population  aged  10-44  by  state  of residence, age, race and Hispanic origin, and marital status were obtained from census data. Vintage 2019 postcensal population estimates for 2011-2019 and decennial census

estimates for 2010 from the U.S. Census Bureau's Application Programming Interface (API) were used to obtain population estimates of females by age group, race and Hispanic origin, and  state  (41).  Population  estimates  by  marital  status  for females  aged  15-44  were  obtained  from  annual  1-year American Community Survey (ACS) data files, also available via  API.  Population  estimates  by  parity  are  not  available in  ACS  or  postcensal  population  data  and,  consequently, pregnancy rates by parity are not provided.

## Covariates

State-level  covariates  for  imputation  models  for  induced abortion  were  from  several  data  sources,  including  ACS (single  year  estimates  for  2010-2019),  the  Guttmacher Institute  (2010-2019),  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  (2018), the National Conference on State Legislatures (2018), Pew Charitable  Trust  (2016),  and  Gallup  polls  (2016),  as  well as  NVSS  data  (birth  and  linked  birth-infant  death  data  for 2010-2019).  Covariates  were  selected  based  on  potential associations  with  induced  abortion  and  missingness  of abortion data, and included:

- Sociodemographic factors
- Age
- Racial and ethnic distribution
- Household size
- Vacant housing units
- Teen birth rates (ages 15-19)
- Birth rates by marital status
- Percentage of the population identifying as 'very religious'

- Poverty rates
- Percentage receiving public assistance (such as from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP]; Supplemental Security Income [SSI]; Special Supplemental Nutrition  Program  for  Women,  Infants,  and  Children [WIC]; or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (42)
- Employment status among people aged 16 and over
- Educational attainment among people aged 25 and over
- Income inequality as measured by the Gini index (43)
- State policy environment
- Family and medical leave laws
- Laws related to abortion
- Laws related to insurance coverage for fertility treatment
- Contraceptive coverage requirements
- Health-related factors
- Health insurance coverage
- Type of insurance
- Infant mortality rates
- Neonatal mortality rates
- Fertility rates
- Unintended pregnancy rates
- Rates of interpersonal violence
- Availability of abortion providers or clinics
- Percentage of females using contraception
- Percentage of females in need of contraceptive services.

## Statistical Analysis

## Live births

The numbers of live births by state of residence, year, and demographic  subgroup  were  tabulated  using  data  from NVSS-Natality  from  2010  through  2019.  Standard  errors were  calculated  using  published  formulas  (44,45).  Births were inversely weighted by plurality,  so  that  the  numbers represented pregnancies (for example, triplet births were  weighted  by  one-third  so  that  they  counted  as  one pregnancy).  Additionally,  for  estimates  by  parity,  one  was subtracted  from  the  parity  variable  in  the  birth  data  file, corresponding to parity for abortions and pregnancy losses (for example, the first live born infant is equivalent to zero prior  live  born  infants,  as  reported  in  the  abortion  and pregnancy loss data sources). Finally, births by marital status are  not  available  from  California  after  2016,  so  estimates by marital status were calibrated to match aggregate total numbers of live births in previously published reports from 2017-2019 (6,46,47).

## Pregnancy losses

Data on fetal deaths were from the NVSS-Fetal Death data files  for  2010-2019.  The  annual  numbers  of  fetal  deaths (occurring at 20 weeks of gestation or more) were calculated by state of residence, maternal age, race and Hispanic origin, and parity. Marital status was only available from 2010-2014. For  2015-2019, the proportion of fetal deaths occurring to married and unmarried people was extrapolated from 2014, with the calibrated proportion of births to married people as described  above  as  a  predictor.  The  estimated  proportions were  then  applied  to  the  overall  fetal  death  numbers  for 2015-2019 to estimate fetal deaths by marital status. Standard errors were calculated using published formulas (13,48).

NSFG pregnancy history data from the 2011-2013, 2013-2015, 2015-2017, and 2017-2019 file releases were used to estimate the ratio of pregnancy losses to live births overall and by demographic subgroup for 2010-2019. Ratios were estimated for losses occurring before 20 weeks and 20 weeks or later, accounting for the complex survey design and sample weights. First, tests of trends in the ratio of losses to live births were done to determine if significant temporal trends were observed in the ratio. No significant trends over the time period were found, so a single estimated ratio of

losses  to  live  births  was  used  for  2010-2019.  The  ratios were estimated separately by demographic group, but due to the small numbers of pregnancies in females under age 15,  a  single  ratio  was  estimated  for  individuals  under  age 20.  The  corresponding  numbers  of  losses  and  standard errors  were  estimated  by  multiplying  the  survey-weighted ratios  (and  standard  errors)  by  the  numbers  of  live  births from NVSS-Natality by state, year, and demographic group.

Estimates  of  the  number  of  losses  before  20  weeks  of gestational age were derived solely from NSFG (and NVSS-Natality),  while  estimates  of  the  number  of  losses occurring at 20 weeks of gestation or later were generated from both NSFG and NVSS-Fetal Death data. To get a single estimate  of  the  number  of  losses  occurring  at  20  weeks of  gestation  or  later,  estimates  from  NSFG  and  NVSSFetal  Death  data  had  to  be  combined.  First,  the  number of  losses  occurring  at  20  weeks  of  gestation  or  later  (and corresponding  standard  errors)  were  estimated  using  the survey-weighted ratios of late losses to live births from NSFG multiplied by the number of live births from NVSS-Natality as described earlier. These estimates were then combined with the number of fetal deaths from the NVSS-Fetal Death data, weighted by the inverse of the variance to account for the larger uncertainty associated with estimates from NSFG.

## Imputation of missing abortion data

To account for missing data on the total number of abortions as well as by demographic characteristics, multiple imputation  was  performed  for  the  2010-2019  abortion data (49). Abortion ratios (number of abortions relative to number  of  live  births)  were  imputed  for  the  three  areas that  did  not  report  any  abortion  data  to  CDC  (California, Maryland, and New Hampshire) and for the states that had missing data on the number of abortions by demographic group during 2010-2019. The demographic groups included:

- Maternal  age  (in  49  reporting  areas):  under  15,  15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40 and over
- Race and Hispanic origin (in 30 reporting areas): Hispanic,  non-Hispanic  Black,  non-Hispanic  White,  and non-Hispanic other race (including Asian, Native Hawaiian or  Other  Pacific  Islander,  multiple  race,  or  other  race). Because  of  differences  in  data  collection  for  race  and Hispanic-origin  groups  across  reporting  areas,  data  for specific  race  and  Hispanic-origin  subgroups  beyond  the three  largest  groups  (non-Hispanic  White,  non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic) are not available
- Marital status (in 42 reporting areas): married (including currently married or separated) or unmarried (including never married, widowed, or divorced)
- Parity  (number  of  previous  live  births;  in  45  reporting areas): zero, one, two, three, or four or more previous live births.

Additionally, the ratio of abortions by state of residence to occurrence was also imputed, as state of residence was only reported  by  48  jurisdictions  (50).  Overall,  across  all  9,880 strata  (52  reporting  areas  including  people  aged  10  and over and 19 demographic groups), 2,188 strata were missing (22%) and needed to be imputed.

Abortion  ratios  by  state,  year,  and  subgroup  (age,  race and Hispanic origin, marital status, and parity) were log-transformed  for  normality  and  missing  values  were imputed  using  multiple  imputation  by  chained  equations (MICE)  in  the  R  statistical  computing  environment  (51). Because  the  abortion  data  were  from  published  tables,  a small number of cells were treated as missing if they were suppressed  in  the  published  tables  due  to  small  counts. Separate models were run to impute abortion ratios overall, and  then  by  age,  race  and  Hispanic  origin,  marital  status, and parity.  Each  model  produced  30  imputations,  with  10 iterations to ensure adequate mixing and convergence.

State-level  (or  equivalent  reporting  area)  covariates  from several different sources were considered for inclusion in the imputation models. Because state regulatory requirements represent one factor (among many) that may impact whether people  travel  between  states  to  obtain  abortion  services, spatial data analyses were conducted to identify clusters of states and spatial outliers with respect to state abortion laws in  2010  and  2019.  Specifically,  Getis-Ord  Gi*  (52)  statistics were  used  to  identify  clusters  of  states  with  either  more permissive or more restrictive laws. Getis-Ord Gi* analyses produce a series of z scores where low values (under -1.96) indicate cold spots and high values (over 1.96) indicate hot spots. These z scores, along with the number of neighboring states, were included as potential covariates in the imputation models  as  a  larger  number  of  neighboring  states  may  be related  to  the  geographic  proximity  of  services  in  nearby states.  Additionally,  Anselin  Local  Moran's  I  (52)  statistics were used to identify spatial outliers, or states with laws that are very different compared with the surrounding states (for example, states with a restrictive legal environment that are surrounded by states with permissive abortion laws, or vice versa).  Anselin  Local  Moran's  I  analyses  produce z scores along  with  an  indication  of  the  type  of  cluster  or  outlier: 1) not part of a cluster; 2) hot spot, or high values surrounded by high values; 3) cold spot, or low values surrounded by low values; 4) spatial outlier, or high values surrounded by low values; or 5) spatial outlier, or low values surrounded by high values.  Including  these  variables  in  the  imputation  models can help account for the spatial dependence between states, where the values for a given state may depend, in part, on the values for the surrounding states.

As  the  over  500  potential  covariates  were  taken  from  a variety of sources and only 520 units of observation (the 50 states, New York City, and D.C. over 10 years), LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) (53) regression models were implemented for feature selection (to reduce the number of covariates included in the imputation models)

using the 'glmnet' package (54) in R 4.0.4  with the equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where yi is  the outcome for each of n reporting areas and years, xij is  the j th standardized predictor (from a total of p predictors)  with  corresponding  coefficient β j ,  and λ is  a tuning  parameter  controlling  the  penalty  associated  with nonzero values of the regression coefficient, β j .

A customized function was developed to use LASSO regression  models  in  MICE  procedures  in  R.  This  function used  LASSO  regression  models  to  impute  missing  values, selecting the optimal value for lambda (the tuning parameter controlling the amount of shrinkage, or degree of penalization applied to the coefficients) by 10-fold cross-validation and minimizing the deviance (squared error). Models were run separately for overall log-transformed abortion ratios, and by age, race and Hispanic origin, marital status, and parity, allowing  for  the  selection  of  different  sets  of  covariates for each subgroup. By randomly selecting the data for the 10-fold cross-validation of the LASSO regression models for each of 30 multiple imputations, the best-performing model and  corresponding  covariates  could  differ  for  each  of  the 30  multiple  imputations.  For  the  first  imputation  of  30, LASSO reduced the number of covariates from over 500 to 42 for overall abortion ratios (Table II), to 27 for the ratio of abortion counts by residence to occurrence, to 13-93 for abortion ratios by age, to 11-34 for abortion ratios by race and Hispanic origin, to 23-34 for abortion ratios by marital status, and to 9-41 for abortion ratios by parity.

Multiply imputed abortion ratios (the number of abortions relative to the number of live births) were then converted to the  number  of  abortions  by  state  of  occurrence  and demographic  group  by  multiplying  the  geometric  mean abortion  ratio  (that  is,  the  exponentiated  mean  of  the log-transformed  abortion  ratio,  equivalent  to  the  median abortion ratio) by the corresponding number of live births. To  convert  estimated  numbers  by  state  of  occurrence  to state of residence, weights were estimated using published tables with the numbers of abortions occurring in each state versus  the  numbers  reported  by  state  of  residence  for 2010-2019 (40).  Values  for  states  that  did  not  report  the numbers  of  abortions  by  state  of  residence  in  all  years (California,  Florida,  Maryland,  and  New  Hampshire)  were multiply imputed using the same processes described earlier, with  the  ratios  first  log-transformed  for  normality.  The geometric means of these imputed residence-to-occurrence ratios were used as weights to generate counts of abortions by state of residence using the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where  the  estimated  number  of  abortions  by  state  of residence s in year t ( Ŷ st ) is a function of the imputed geometric mean abortion ratio, exp( ρ st ), the corresponding number of live births ( ) β st , and the geometric mean of the ratio of the count of abortions by residence to occurrence, exp( ω st ).

For each of the 30 imputations, estimates by subgroup were calibrated  to  the  estimated  total  number  of  abortions  for each state and year. For example, the sum of the estimated numbers for each age group was constrained to equal the total  estimated  number  of  abortions.  The  imputed  values were  then  pooled  using  Rubin's  rule  (49)  to  estimate the  numbers  of  abortions  by  residence,  overall,  and  by demographic  subgroup  for  2010-2019,  along  with  the corresponding standard errors.

## Pregnancy intention

NSFG pregnancy history data from the 2011-2013, 2013-2015, 2015-2017, and 2017-2019 file releases were used  to  estimate  the  proportion  of  pregnancies  ending in  loss  or  live  birth  for  2010-2019  that  were  unintended at conception (defined as 'too soon, mistimed' or 'unwanted') (55,56). The proportions were estimated overall  and  by  demographic  subgroup,  accounting  for  the complex survey design and sample weights, and trend tests were conducted to identify significant trends over time in the proportions of pregnancies ending in loss or live birth that were unintended. The estimated proportions by group and  year  were  multiplied  by  the  corresponding  estimated numbers of live births and total pregnancy losses to obtain estimated  numbers  of  unintended  pregnancies  ending  in live birth or loss. Additionally, 95% of pregnancies ending in abortion were assumed to be unintended based on previous literature  reporting  that  intended  pregnancies  account  for less than 5% of all abortions (57-59).

## Data integration models

To  estimate  pregnancy  rates  from  live  births,  pregnancy losses,  and  induced  abortions,  parametric  bootstrapping (60,61) was used where the estimated numbers and variance for  each  outcome  were  used  to  generate  1,000  random draws from a normal distribution, and then the median value and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were used to estimate total pregnancies  and  corresponding  95%  confidence  intervals (95%  CIs).  For  pregnancy  losses,  the  observed  estimates from NSFG and NVSS-Fetal Death data for pregnancy losses at 20 weeks of gestational age or later were first combined by weighting the estimates by the inverse of the variance.

The number  of unintended pregnancies by year and demographic  group was estimated by multiplying the number  of  pregnancies  ending  in each  outcome  (live birth,  pregnancy  loss,  and  abortion)  by  the  corresponding proportion that were unintended. Parametric bootstrapping was used as described to estimate the numbers of unintended pregnancies  and  95%  CIs.  Overall  pregnancy  rates  were calculated as the estimated total number of pregnancies per 1,000 females aged 15-44, and by demographic subgroup. Similarly, unintended pregnancy rates were calculated as  the  estimated  number  of  unintended  pregnancies  per

1,000 females aged 15-44, and by demographic subgroup. All  estimated  numbers  of  pregnancies  were  rounded  to the nearest 1,000 (or 100 in the case of groups with small numbers of pregnancies).

All differences in rates or numbers between 2010 and 2019 are statistically significant at the 0.05 level unless otherwise noted, based on pairwise z -tests  (44).  As  the  focus  of  this report was to describe updated methodology for estimating pregnancy  rates  and  not  to  examine  trends  over  time  by group,  detailed  analyses  of  nonlinear  trends  and  patterns were not performed, and differences between groups were not tested for statistical significance.

## Sensitivity analyses

Because abortions may be underreported in CDC abortion surveillance  data,  in  part  due  to  incomplete  reporting  in certain  jurisdictions,  simulations  were  also  implemented assuming  that  abortions  were  about  15%  higher  than reported. In 2017, CDC's abortion surveillance data included 612,719 abortions (23), while Guttmacher data (62) for the same reporting areas included in CDC abortion surveillance data (excluding California, Maryland, and New Hampshire) included  697,670  abortions,  about  14%  higher  than  in CDC  abortion  surveillance  data.  Therefore,  assuming  that abortions  are  about  15%  higher  than  reported  in  CDC abortion surveillance data is consistent with the magnitude of observed differences between the two data sources.

## Comparison with previously published estimates

Estimates of pregnancy rates for 2010 were compared with previously published estimates (2) overall and for selected demographic groups to describe the impact of the updated methodology. The percentage differences from the previous estimates were calculated overall and by age group and race and Hispanic origin.

## Results

An  estimated  6,069,000  pregnancies  occurred  in  2010, declining 9% to 5,507,000 in 2019 (Table A). Figure 2 shows trends in the number of pregnancies, live births, abortions, and pregnancy losses for 2010-2019. The overall pregnancy rate  (the  estimated  number  of  pregnancies  per  1,000 females  aged  15-44)  was  97.3  in  2010,  declining  by  12% to  85.6  in  2019  (Table  A).  The  percentage  of  pregnancies ending in live birth increased from 64.8% in 2010 to 66.9% in 2019, while the percentage ending in abortion declined from 15.8% to 13.1%, and the percentage ending in loss increased from 19.4% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2019.

## Patterns by Age

By age, estimated pregnancy rates declined by at least 50% for  2010-2019 for young people under age 20 (under age 15: 1.0 per 1,000 to 0.4, a decline of 60%; aged 15-19: 60.8

per 1,000 to 29.4, a decline of 52%) (Figure 3 and Table III). Pregnancy rates also declined 29% for women aged 20-24 (from 139.3 to 98.8) and 14% for women aged 25-29 (from 154.3  to  132.6).  For  women  aged  30-34,  pregnancy  rates were essentially the same in 2019 (139.7) as in 2010 (139.1). For women aged 35 and over, pregnancy rates were higher in  2019  than  in  2010.  For  women  aged  35-39,  pregnancy rates increased by 11% from 69.1 to 77.0. For women aged 40 and over, pregnancy rates increased 15%, from 21.5 to 24.7. In 2010, women aged 25-29 (154.3) had the highest estimated pregnancy rates followed by women aged 20-24 (139.3), but in 2019, the group with the highest estimated pregnancy rates was women aged 30-34 (139.7), followed by women aged 25-29 (132.6).

## Patterns by Race and Hispanic Origin

Pregnancy  rates  declined  by  21%  for  Hispanic  females, from 108.6 in 2010 to 85.5 in 2019 (Figure 4 and Table III). Pregnancy  rates  declined  by  10%  for  non-Hispanic  Black females, from 122.5 to 109.8. Declines were smaller for nonHispanic  White  females,  with  pregnancy  rates  decreasing 8%,  from  90.1  to  82.6.  For  non-Hispanic  females  of  other racial  groups, pregnancy rates declined by 15%, from 80.4 to 68.7.

## Patterns by Marital Status

Pregnancy  rates  for  unmarried  females  declined  by  19%, from 81.8 in 2010 to 66.4 in 2019, while rates for married females were relatively stable (from 118.4 to 115.7, respectively) (Figure 5 and Table III).

## Patterns by Parity

Pregnancy  rates  were  not  available  by  parity  due  to  the lack of population denominators by parity. However, trends in the number of pregnancies from 2010 to 2019 by parity group can be seen in Figure 6 and Table IV. The number of pregnancies  declined  by  14%  for  females  with  zero  prior live births, from 2.38 million in 2010 to 2.05 million in 2019; this  group  also  had  the  highest  number  of  pregnancies throughout  the  time  period.  Declines  from  2010  to  2019 were smaller for females with one prior live birth (8%), two prior live births (6%), and three prior live births (5%). The number  of  pregnancies  increased  by  3%  for  females  with four or more prior live births. These differences in numbers were not tested for statistical significance.

## Unintended Pregnancies

Rates of  unintended pregnancies declined overall by 15%, from 42.1 per 1,000 females aged 15-44 in 2010 to 35.7 in 2019 (Table B). Rates of unintended pregnancy also declined for all age groups except for women aged 35-39 and 40 and over, for whom rates increased by 5% and 8%, respectively

(Figure  7  and  Table  C).  From  2010  to  2019,  unintended pregnancy rates  declined  by  14%  for  women  aged  25-29, 31%  for  those  aged  20-24,  and  52%  for  teenagers  aged 15-19. Unintended pregnancy rates and percentages for  children  and  teens  under  age  15  are  not  reported,  as pregnancies in this age group may disproportionately result from rape or abuse, so the construct of 'intention' is not appropriate for this younger age group (63).

By  race  and  Hispanic  origin,  unintended  pregnancy  rates declined  from  2010  to  2019  by  23%  for  Hispanic  females, 17%  for  non-Hispanic  females  of  other  races,  12%  for non-Hispanic Black females, and 11% for non-Hispanic White females (Figure 8 and Table C). By marital status, unintended pregnancy  rates  declined  from  2010  to  2019  by  20%  for unmarried females and 5% for married females (Figure 9 and Table C).

The percentage of pregnancies that were unintended overall and by demographic group can be seen in Tables B and D,  respectively,  with  women  aged  25-29  being  the  only group to show a nonsignificant change in the percentage of pregnancies that were unintended from 2010 to 2019.

## Comparisons With Previously Published Estimates

Estimates shown in this report are lower than the previously published estimates for 2010 using the older methodology (Table  V)  (2).  For  example,  the  previous  methods  resulted in an estimated 2010 pregnancy rate of 98.7, corresponding to  6.155  million  pregnancies.  The  updated  methodology presented in this report resulted in an estimated pregnancy rate of 97.3 (6.069 million pregnancies) in  2010,  1% lower  than  the  previous  estimate.  By  age  and  race  and Hispanic origin, pregnancy rates estimated using the new  methodology  were  within  1%-11%  of  the  previous estimates. Nearly all of the available previous estimates of pregnancy  rates  for  2010  were  within  the  95%  CIs  of  the estimates  provided  in  this  report,  with  two  exceptions. The  updated  2010  estimate  for  women  aged  35-39  (69.1 pregnancies per 100,000 women;  95%  CI: 63.5-74.6) was 10% lower than the previous estimate (76.5) and the previous estimate was not within the 95% CI shown here. Additionally,  the  updated  2010  estimate  for  non-Hispanic White females (90.1 pregnancies per 100,000 females; 95% CI: 86.1-94.1) was 7% higher than the previously published estimate (84.1) and the older estimate was outside the 95% CI  shown  here.  Finally,  the  percentages  of  pregnancies  by outcome were very similar using the previous methodology (65% live births, 18% abortions, and 17% pregnancy losses) compared with the updated methodology (65% live births, 16% abortions, and 19% pregnancy losses).

## Discussion

This report describes an updated methodology for estimating pregnancy  rates  in  the  United  States  using  several  data sources from CDC and NCHS. By imputing missing data from

CDC's Abortion Surveillance System, more timely estimates of pregnancy rates and unintended pregnancies can be made available as these data are published annually. Historically, pregnancy rate estimates for the United States have relied on abortion data from periodic abortion provider surveys, which were only conducted every few years and published 2 or 3 years after data collection. By integrating data from multiple data systems, including NSFG and NVSS (birth and fetal  death  data),  this  report  shows  continued  declines  in pregnancy rates in the United States through 2019 and for most  demographic  groups.  Unintended  pregnancy  rates also  declined  for  most  groups,  though  the  percentage  of unintended pregnancies was relatively steady for 2010-2019 at 41%-43% and remained above the Healthy People 2030 target of 36.5% (4).

Larger  percentage  declines  in  unintended  pregnancy  rates were seen among younger age groups, and those patterns were  mirrored  for  pregnancy  rates  overall,  declining  by 52%  for  teenagers  aged  15-19.  Additionally,  unintended pregnancy rates declined the most among Hispanic females (23%),  with  unintended  pregnancy  rates  converging  from 59% higher than those among non-Hispanic White females in 2010 to 38% higher in 2019. The unintended pregnancy rates among non-Hispanic Black females also declined from 2010  to  2019  (by  12%),  but  remained  more  than  twice as high in 2019 (63.2 per 1,000 females) as rates for nonHispanic White females (28.2 per 1,000 females).

Estimates shown in this report (97.3 pregnancies per 100,000 females, representing about 6.069 million pregnancies) are 1%  lower  than  previously  published  estimates  for  2010 (98.7, representing 6.155 million pregnancies) (2). Estimates may  differ  for  several  reasons,  as  changes  were  made  in calculating each pregnancy outcome (live births, abortions, and  pregnancy  losses).  In  this  updated  methodology,  the number of live  births  was  adjusted  for  multiple  births,  so that  each  pregnancy  was  only  counted  once  (instead  of multiple  births  each  being  counted  separately,  as  was  the case previously), resulting in a lower number of pregnancies ending  in  live  birth  (3.929  million  compared  with  3.999 million using the previous methodology). Pregnancy losses were estimated using the ratio of losses to live births and incorporated  data  on  fetal  deaths  from  NVSS,  while  the previous methodology used losses as a proportion of the sum of live births and losses and did not use fetal death data. This modification resulted in a higher number of pregnancy losses estimated  with  the  updated  methodology  (1.177  million in  2010  compared  with  1.053  million  using  the  previous methodology). The overall estimated number of abortions in  2010  was  also  lower  using  this  updated  methodology (958,200) compared with the previous methodology (1.103 million) that relied on different methods and data sources for abortions. By age and race and Hispanic origin, pregnancy rates estimated using the new methodology were generally within 1%-11% of the previously published estimates and the previous estimates were nearly all within the 95% CIs of the

estimates in this report except for two demographic groups (non-Hispanic White females and women aged 35-39). The larger discrepancies for these two groups could be driven by the  factors  noted  earlier  related  to  different  data  sources and methods for estimating pregnancy components, which may impact various groups differently. Additionally, by age, larger  percentage  differences  were  seen  for  age  groups with  the  smallest  pregnancy  rates,  where  there  is  likely more variability or uncertainty due to the smaller numbers. Although the estimates shown in this report are similar to previous estimates for 2010, they should not be compared with previous estimates to describe longer-term trends due to the differences in methodology.

This analysis has several limitations. First, this analysis does not capture abortions obtained by U.S. residents traveling to  other  countries.  Second,  pregnancy  rate  estimates  may understate the risk of pregnancy in the youngest age group given that the denominators represent the total population of females aged 10-14 years, many of whom may not be at risk of pregnancy. Third, the number of abortions estimated by imputing missing data from CDC's Abortion Surveillance System  is  about  15%  lower  than  the  numbers  published by  other  data  sources  for  2011-2017  (18,23,26,62).  It  is possible  that  abortions  are  underestimated,  which  would lead to pregnancy rate estimates that are too low. Sensitivity analyses  assuming  that  abortions  are  15%  higher  than reported  estimates  resulted  in  pregnancy  rates  that  were

2% higher, on average, for 2010-2019 but were also within the 95% CIs of the original estimates (Table VI). Estimated unintended pregnancy rates shown here are also consistent with estimates published in other studies, including a recent analysis examining country-specific estimates of unintended pregnancy  for  2015-2019  (64).  The  estimated  rate  from that study was about 35 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 females (64) compared with estimated rates in this report of 35.7-38.1 unintended pregnancies over that same time period. An older study reported unintended pregnancy rates of  45  per  1,000  females  in  2011  (5),  which  is  somewhat higher  than  the  rates  shown  in  this  report  for  2010-2011 (42.1 and 40.6, respectively).

Earlier  studies  have  noted  that  using  a  binary  measure  of pregnancy intention provides a very crude assessment of the complex  feelings  and  attitudes  toward  pregnancy  (64-68), but unintended pregnancy as defined by this binary measure has documented associations with factors affecting maternal and  child  well-being,  such  as  prenatal  care,  breastfeeding, and  longer-term  effects  throughout  childhood  (69-71).  The binary measure is commonly used in tracking progress toward national health objectives related to decreasing the proportion of pregnancies that are unintended (4). Estimates shown here related to pregnancy intention are also limited in that state-level variability was not accounted for, and data from other sources suggest that there is geographic variation in the percentage of pregnancies or live births that are unintended (59,72).

Additionally,  many  factors  affecting  pregnancy  rates  (such as state variation in abortion and contraceptive access, birth rates,  and  socioeconomic  factors)  have  changed  in  recent years  (73,74).  These  changes  may  not  be  reflected  in  the various data sources used in the imputation models, which are often only available periodically; some covariates were only  available  for  a  single  year  during  the  study  period. Future updates to this analysis will be challenging given all of the changes that occurred in 2020 and later (74) affecting various aspects of reproductive health, along with potential but  unknown  changes  in  data  quality  and  reporting  since 2020. Changes in data availability by demographic factors, such  as  marital  status  or  how  race  and  Hispanic  origin  is reported, will limit future analyses and the ability to examine trends over time. For example, marital status is no longer available in NVSS-Fetal Death data, and changes in race and Hispanic-origin reporting were introduced for 2010-2019 as jurisdictions in NVSS adopted the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for reporting race and Hispanic origin (75). Data are only provided for the three largest race and ethnicity groups given the need to harmonize this variable across various data systems, leading to a gap in information about  several  subpopulations  including  those  within  the non-Hispanic  other  race  category  as  well  as  Hispanic-origin subgroups. Finally, further methodological work may provide additional insights  about  how  pregnancy  rates  vary  by geographic factors such as state or urban-rural residence.

The methodology described in this report allows for the  publication  of  more  timely  estimates  of  overall  and unintended pregnancy rates to inform policies and programs to decrease  the percentage  of  unintended  pregnancy. Importantly, due to differences in timeliness of availability for some of the data sources used to estimate pregnancy rates, further evaluation will be needed to determine if production of preliminary estimates using interim or previously imputed data, for example, may be feasible. This includes pregnancy loss data from NSFG, which is currently produced every other year.  In  addition,  more  substantial  evaluation  of  potential recent  changes  in  abortion  reporting  and  corresponding data quality (73) may be needed before future updates of the  data  presented  in  this  report.  However,  the  goal  is  to produce more regular and timely updates to these rates in the future. The availability of timelier estimates of pregnancy rates and unintended pregnancies will be crucial for tracking reproductive  health  outcomes  in  the  United  States,  as  is consistent with U.S. health objectives.

NOTES: For categorical variables with multiple levels, including the spatial outlier type, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model could select any number of levels associated with this variable. For example, spatial outliers were categorized as: 1) not part of a cluster; 2) hot spot, or high values surrounded by high values; 3) cold spot, or low values surrounded by low values; 4) spatial outlier, or high values surrounded by low values; and 5) spatial outlier, or low values surrounded by high values. Typically, all of these levels are included as indicator variables, with the first category omitted as the reference category. In cases where only one level of the variable was selected in the LASSO regression, the reference group for that variable would consist of all the other levels of the variable (all the levels that were omitted from the model).
