## PREGNANCY DO'S AND DON'TS

- ***These are general guidelines for most low risk pregnancies. Please consult with your doctor if you are unsure if these recommendations apply to you and your pregnancy.***

## ACTIVITIES

- In general, you may continue to do your usual activities but please avoid motorcycle riding, snow skiing, saunas, horseback riding, water skiing, hot tubs/jacuzzis

## EXERCISE

- At least 150 minutes of moderate intensity (enough to raise your heart rate and sweat and you can talk normally but you cannot sing) aerobic exercise is recommended every week to help reduce back pain, reduce constipation, help decrease risk of gestational diabetes/preeclampsia/cesarean section, avoid unhealthy weight gain, improve overall general fitness, help you to lose weight after the baby is born.
- If you are new to exercise, start slowly and gradually increase your activity.
- Precautions: drink plenty of watery to avoid dehydration, wear a supportive sports bra, avoid very hot weather, and avoid lying flat on your back in the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters.
- Avoid: contact sports, 'hot yoga/pilates', activities above 6,000 feet, scuba diving
- Warning signs: vaginal bleeding, feeling dizzy, shortness of breath before starting exercise, chest pain, headache, muscle weakness, calf pain or swelling, regular painful contractions, fluid leaking from the vagina.

## WEIGHT GAIN

- Recommended weight gain depends on your prepregnancy weight (body mass index). You may only gain 1-5lbs during your first trimester (or none at all). If you were normal weight prior to pregnancy, you should gain 0.5-1lb a week in the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. If you were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy, you should aim for about 0.5lb/week.

Body Mass Index(BMI)=Weight(kg)/[Height(m)]²

## NUTRITION - https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/nutrition-during-pregnancy

- Instead of 'eating for two', try to each twice as healthy and increase your calories about 340 calories a day starting in the 2nd trimester (600 calories a day if twins, 900 calories a day if triplets).

## CAFFEINE

- Moderate caffeine use (&lt;200mg per day) is not likely to increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm birth

## TRAVEL

- In most cases, pregnancy women can travel safely until close to their due dates. But travel may not be recommended for women who have pregnancy complications. If you are planning a trip, talk to your doctor.
- Most airlines allow pregnant women to fly domestically until about 36 weeks of pregnancy. The cut off may be earlier for international flights.
- More information about travel: https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/travel-during-pregnancy

## MEDICATIONS

- Below is a list of medications that are likely safe to take during pregnancy. Medications not listed does not necessarily mean they are safe or unsafe but may require a discussion of the risks and benefits of use during pregnancy
- Pain relievers: acetamenophin (max of 3000mg/day). Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen/advil, naproxen/aleve). You may be prescribed low dose aspirin 81mg a day if you have risk factors for preeclampsia. This dosage is ok to take, but do not take full dose aspirin (325mg a day).
- Allergies: claritin, Zyrtec, hydroxyzine, Benadryl, rhinocort (fluticasone/budesonide) spray. Pseudoephedrine (decongestant) has been linked to small risk of abdominal wall birth defects. If the benefits outweigh the risks of using this medication, do not use during the first 3 months of pregnancy.
- Cough: cough drops, chlorseptic spray, robitussin DM, gaufenesin
- Acid reflux: Pepcid AC, Maalox, Mylanta, tums
- Anti-diarrheal: Imodium
- Nausea: ginger ale, ginger snaps, peppermint, unisom tablets
- Stool softener: colace/docusate, milk of magnesia, Metamucil, miralax
- Hemorrhoids: preparation H, anusol
