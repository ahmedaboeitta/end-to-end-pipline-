## TRACKING YOUR WEIGHT

For Women Who Begin Pregnancy Overweight

The amount of weight you gain during pregnancy is important for the health of your pregnancy and for the long-term health of you and your baby. If you were overweight (body mass index 25.0-29.9) before pregnancy, you should gain 15-25 pounds during pregnancy.

Learn steps you can take to meet your pregnancy weight gain goal.

## What Steps Can You Take to Meet Pregnancy Weight Gain Recommendations?

- y Work with your health care provider on your weight gain goals at the beginning and regularly throughout your pregnancy.
- y Track your pregnancy weight gain at the beginning and regularly throughout pregnancy and compare your progress to recommended ranges of healthy weight gain. Weigh yourself without shoes, wearing light weight clothing, and using the same scale ideally on the same day and time each week.
- y Eat a balanced diet high in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, low fat dairy, and lean protein. Use the MyPlate daily checklist to see the daily food group targets that are right for you at your stage of pregnancy. Talk with your health care provider or visit Checklist of Foods to Avoid During Pregnancy for information about food safety in pregnancy.
- y Limit added sugars and solid fats found in foods like soft drinks, desserts, fried foods, whole milk, and fatty meats.
- y Know your calorie needs. In general, the first trimester (or first three months) does not require any extra calories . Typically, women who begin pregnancy overweight need an additional 200400 calories per day during the second trimester (second three months) and an additional 400

calories per day during the third (last) trimester.* Additional calories can be met by adding in two healthy snacks per day, such as in the morning and afternoon. Sample healthy snack ideas are below.

- y Work up to or maintain at least 150 minutes (2½ hours) of moderate intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) per week. 150 minutes may sound overwhelming, but you can achieve your goal by breaking up your physical activity into 10 minutes at a time. Physical activity is healthy and safe for most pregnant women. Talk to your health care provider to determine if you have any physical activity restrictions.

## Instructions for the Weight Gain Tracker and Weight Gain Chart

-    Write your weight (rounded to the nearest pound) just before you became pregnant in the space provided on the weight gain tracker. 40
-    Based on your week of pregnancy * , write today's date and your weight (rounded to the nearest pound) in the spaces provided on the weight gain tracker. 35
-    Write today' s weight gain in the space provided on the weight gain tracker. To determine today's weight gain, subtract your weight just before pregnancy from today's weight. Example: subtract your weight just before pregnancy (160 pounds) from today's weight (165 pounds) to determine today's weight gain (5 pounds). 25 30
-    If your weight gain is within the shaded area on the weight gain chart, you're on track. If you're outside of the shaded area, you can make small adjustments with your diet and physical activity to get back on track. You should not try to lose weight during pregnancy.
-    Y ou can print the chart and graph your weight gain by hand. Graph your weight gain by placing an 'x' where your week of pregnancy and your weight gain meet on the weight gain chart. 20 Weight Gain in Pounds
